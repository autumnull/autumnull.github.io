    <p>Been busy. Time for subsections.</p>
<h3> Seagulls</h3>
<p>There've been some baby seagulls growing up on the roof across from us since we moved in. They're real round and fluffy and keep their necks hunched all the time. They just waddle around and yell for food sometimes. One of them was more developed than the other. We were just waiting for them to start flying pretty much, we could see them thinking about it. Then we saw the older one just walking in the road one day, probably just landed, looked very silly just walkin around, refused to fly to avoid people and just kept walking as fast as it could. We laughed a lot.</p>
<h3> Fuckin</h3>
<p>Been having weird brain about fuckin - don't know anyone in this new place; got a penis; got strange hangups; don't have a phone that can use dating apps: etc. Anyway after some lamenting i've ordered a burner android so i can find ppl to fuck. And maybe make friends.</p>
<h3> Server</h3>
<p>We got internet. No more walking to the library for free wifi. This means i'm back doing things on the server tho.</p>
<ul>
<li>Found a bunch of webrings (too many), we've been sorting thru them to put them on the webgasket. </li>
<li>Made cards.tranarchy.fish with rowan - try this:</li>
</ul>
<pre class="blockcode">$ curl cards.tranarchy.fish/~autumn</pre><h3> Community Garden</h3>
<p>Found out we live next to a sweet community garden. They've got a big bee hive, vegetable patches, fruit trees, little memorials dotted around, it's very lovely. Want to try and do things to help out there.</p>
