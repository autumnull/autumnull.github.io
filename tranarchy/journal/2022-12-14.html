    <p>Have watched nearly all of TOS.</p>
<p>I went to visit a friend in Belfast for most of a week, to get a change of scenery and to hang out. That was really nice. I love her a lot and i'm glad we got to just lay around in bed together for a week. I think we both came out of it appreciating each other in new ways which is really fulfilling.</p>
<p>Relationship anxiety is at an all-time low (as in good - not much anxiety), which is nice. I just kinda decided to trust what people say about their feelings and now i do. I'm very content.</p>
<p>Still haven't resolved my HRT situation but i have at least planned out a regimen to switch to and ordered the meds. I'm still pissy but i've sorted stuff out a bit better. I'm mainly pissy actually that I bothered to trust the NHS to tell me what meds to take for so long. Definitely not worth it. Anyway i'm gona get on E injections like i intended to before i got with the GIC.</p>
<p>It's getting cold! really cold. Milo said i might've got a cold injury the other day just from being indoors in bed. brr. I have acquired a cute black cosy dressing gown with a hood which is helping. Rowan also maybe figured out how the heating works, we don't rly know. It's still pretty fucking cold in here tho so i'm collecting cosy items to adorn myself with.</p>
<p>Generally i'm doing pretty good i think. I don't have much energy to do things in the cold but my anxiety is a lot less. I had a date yesterday that was cute in spite of the cold and have another date this weekend that i'm looking forward to. Kirk out.</p>
