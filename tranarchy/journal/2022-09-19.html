    <p>Worked a shit-ton on a text editor. Lost all sense of time, don't remember anything at all for like, a week or more in there. But the text editor works, basically. I'll write a proper segment about it at some point. Forgot to take my meds somewhere in there which didn't help, went fully catatonic and couldn't do anything at all. Anyway it was fine.</p>
<p><a href="https://git.sr.ht/~autumnull/toasted">The text editor is called Toasted</a></p>
<p>Feeling better about the relationship issues, and the sexuality as a result. Had a really really lovely date with 3 trans ppl. Have been feeling more connected to people, very compassionate, very in love. Navigating networks of relationships and deciphering my feelings, think it's good for me.</p>
<p>Spent the last few days fixing up the server.</p>
