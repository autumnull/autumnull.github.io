    <p>Finished watching TOS forever ago now. It lives in an endearing little place in my heart.</p>
<p>Have written various little projects in Hare that I'm really happy with:<br/>
<a href="https://git.sr.ht/~autumnull/haredump">haredump - a little file embedding program</a><br/>
<a href="https://git.sr.ht/~autumnull/haredo">haredo - a simple little build automator</a><br/>
<a href="https://git.sr.ht/~autumnull/treecat">treecat - a directory displaying and archiving tool</a></p>
<p>I'm currently working (incessantly) on:<br/>
<a href="https://git.sr.ht/~autumnull/lagomorph">lagomorph - Parsing Expression Grammars</a><br/>
and i'm determined to get it to have all the specific neat features that i want: linear time, left recursion, incremental parsing, error recovery. I must've been working on it for about a month already. After that i wana write a silly APL interpreter and then maybe get back to writing Toasted.</p>
<p>I apparently didn't write any journals for pretty much the whole of winter, but I had a good time in general. I won't remember all of it but I have a lot less &quot;what the fuck happened&quot; feelings about it than my last journal entries. There was some really beautiful absurdities in there, my room was covered in glitter for several weeks because i fucked a guy who'd spilled glitter all over himself, i still find dots of glitter attached to my genitals pretty regularly. I have loved so deeply and cared for so openly. I am proud and surrounded in spirits. I haven't had any new dates because rowan broke their phone and is using the one i used to use for fucking. It's becoming spring and it's gorgeous, and i'm gorgeous, and the rain is sweet and and and and ugh i feel like every winter i pass through i come out the other side taller and more passionate. The collection of people i talk to regularly are coarsing with disparate imaginations and interests and it's really lovely.</p>
<p>I'm on injectable E and bica. Seems to be working better, i started lactating which is fun (and i'm definitely not using it for sex, that would be a pervert thing to do and i've never been perverse in my life). glad to be back to self-medding, if annoyed that i gave up that agency for a little while.</p>
<p>I'm in love in so many ways and with so many things :)</p>
