    <blockquote> CW: Non-Consensual Sex</blockquote>
<p>Mainly been thinking about/doing sex stuff. Got Lex and Feeld on the burner phone. Shite phone, fit for purpose. Neither app is good to use, sick of apps. Found out lots of ppl think i'm hot tho, so that's nice. We went to a kink munch which was genuinely nice, met some very lovely trans girls, one of whom i got on really well with - she was gorgeous and we were very into each other so we ended up fucking in the bathroom. Wanna hang out with her so much more, can't wait to see her again.</p>
<p>Got increasingly horny to the point where I pretty much wasn't functioning. Arranged 2 meet up with some dom trans guy off feeld but i cancelled and he went off the handle so good that i dodged that one, but then walked straight into inviting some vaguely-fem enby over that i'd just matched, who wasn't how i thought they'd be, and had some bad non-consensual sex. Then had a breakdown about it in the shower. Have been feeling depressed and dissociated since then. Anyway have invited a trans couple off feeld who seem chill over for dinner, kinda just want some friends at this point, had enough of thinking about fuckin for a bit.</p>
