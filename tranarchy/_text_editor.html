  <h1>Text editor.</h1>
    
    
    <p>atom getting deprecated and wasn't that great anyway, despite being the best i found. gonna make a text editor.</p>
<h2> Research.</h2>
<h3> Emacs.</h3>
<p>What the fuck is this. There's way too much in this and none of it makes any sense?? Why is there a literal web browser in here? Why does it look like garbage? Is this even a text editor? Why does it contain GDB? and IRC and mail and news and video games? Bad technology. I would simply use a terminal.</p>
<ul>
<li>Terrible shortcuts and terrible description of those shortcuts; don't make me read a dang tutorial in order to use the basics of a text editor!! &quot;Emacs has thousands of commands&quot; Fuck you! I ain't readin all that.</li>
<li>Very opaque, obviously way too much functionality</li>
<li>Looks real bad</li>
</ul>
<p>The only real reason i wanted to look at emacs was the lisp built into it. This interests me. Clearly they went off the rails with power at some point but find and replace with lisp is neat and good, the programmability of many parts seems like a decent idea.</p>
<h3> Atom.</h3>
<p>Chromium based, packed to the brim with WEB DESIGN. In my OFFLINE APPLICATION. Real heavy, feels it. Hackable but seems to be mildly more normal about it than emacs. Still provides customizability for far too much of the application. Obviously fucked because created by github.</p>
<h3> Micro.</h3>
<p>Weirdly bloated? Simultaneously under-featured and over-featured. Syntax highlighting is not free enough, due to Go's regex being shit. </p>
<h3> Other.</h3>
<p><a href="http://http://texteditors.org">http://texteditors.org is the best website i have ever seen.</a></p>
<h2> Design.</h2>
<p>A text editor - even one as simple as ED: THE STANDARD EDITOR - never provides a direct interface to the underlying text. It shows an interpretation of the text, which is a prerequisite for interaction. &quot;Text&quot; in computers is not really text. It is a series of bytes. A text editor cuts certain corners in order to show you this series of bytes in a way that pretends it is text.</p>
