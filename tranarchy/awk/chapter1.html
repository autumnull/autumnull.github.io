    <h2 id="an-awk-tutorial">1 AN AWK TUTORIAL</h2>
<p>Awk is a convenient and expressive programming language that can be
applied to a wide variety of computing and data-manipulation tasks. This
chapter is a tutorial, designed to let you start writing your own
programs as quickly as possible. Chapter 2 describes the whole language,
and the remaining chapters show how awk can be used to solve problems
from many different areas. Throughout the book, we have tried to pick
examples that you should find useful, interesting, and instructive.</p>
<h3 id="getting-started">1.1 Getting Started</h3>
<p>Useful awk programs are often short, just a line or two. Suppose you
have a file called <code>emp.data</code> that contains the name, pay
rate in dollars per hour, and number of hours worked for your employees,
one employee record per line, like this:</p>
<pre><code>Beth	4.00	0
Dan	3.75	0
Kathy	4.00	10
Mark	5.00	20
Mary	5.50	22
Susie	4.25	18</code></pre>
<p>Now you want to print the name and pay (rate times hours) for
everyone who worked more than zero hours. This is the kind of job that
awk is meant for, so it’s easy. Just type this command line:</p>
<pre><code>awk &#39;$3 &gt; 0 { print $1, $2 * $3 }&#39; emp.data</code></pre>
<p>You should get this output:</p>
<pre><code>Kathy 40
Mark 100
Mary 121
Susie 76.5</code></pre>
<p>This command line tells the system to run awk, using the program
inside the quote characters, taking its data from the input file
<code>emp.data</code>. The part inside the quotes is the complete awk
program. It consists of a single <em>pattern-action statement</em>. The
pattern, <code>$3 &gt; 0</code>, matches every input line in which the
third column, or <em>field</em>, is greater than zero, and the
action</p>
<pre><code>{ print $1, $2 * $3 }</code></pre>
<p>prints the first field and the product of the second and third fields
of each matched line.</p>
<p>If you want to print the names of those employees who did not work,
type this command line:</p>
<pre><code>awk &#39;$3 == 0 { print $1 }&#39; emp.data</code></pre>
<p>Here the pattern, $3 == 0, matches each line in which the third field
is equal to zero, and the action</p>
<pre><code>{ print $1 }</code></pre>
<p>prints its first field.</p>
<p>As you read this book, try running and modifying the programs that
are presented. Since most of the programs are short, you’ll quickly get
an understanding of how awk works. On a Unix system, the two
transactions above would look like this on the terminal:</p>
<pre><code>$ awk &#39;$3 &gt; 0 { print $1, $2 * $3 }&#39; emp.data
Kathy 40
Mark 100
Mary 121
Susie 76.5
$ awk &#39;$3 == 0 { print $1 }&#39; emp.data
Beth
Dan
$</code></pre>
<p>The <code>$</code> at the beginning of a line is the prompt from the
system; it may be different on your machine.</p>
<h4 id="the-structure-of-an-awk-program">The Structure of an AWK
Program</h4>
<p>Let’s step back a moment and look at what is going on. In the command
lines above, the parts between the quote characters are programs written
in the awk programming language. Each awk program in this chapter is a
sequence of one or more pattern-action statements:</p>
<pre><code><i>pattern</i> { <i>action</i> }
<i>pattern</i> { <i>action</i> }
...</code></pre>
<p>The basic operation of awk is to scan a sequence of input lines one
after another, searching for lines that are <em>matched</em> by any of
the patterns in the program. The precise meaning of the word “match”
depends on the pattern in question; for patterns like
<code>$3 &gt; 0</code>, it means “the condition is true.”</p>
<p>Every input line is tested against each of the patterns in turn. For
each pattern that matches, the corresponding action (which may involve
multiple steps) is performed. Then the next line is read and the
matching starts over. This continues until all the input has been
read.</p>
<p>The programs above are typical examples of patterns and actions.</p>
<pre><code>$3 == 0 { print $1 }</code></pre>
<p>is a single pattern-action statement; for every line in which the
third field is zero, the first field is printed.</p>
<p>Either the pattern or the action (but not both) in a pattern-action
statement may be omitted. If a pattern has no action, for example,</p>
<pre><code>$3 == 0</code></pre>
<p>then each line that the pattern matches (that is, each line for which
the condition is true) is printed. This program prints the two lines
from the <code>emp.data</code> file where the third field is zero:</p>
<pre><code>Beth	4.00	0
Dan	3.75	0</code></pre>
<p>If there is an action with no pattern, for example,</p>
<pre><code>{ print $1 }</code></pre>
<p>then the action, in this case printing the first field, is performed
for every input line.</p>
<p>Since patterns and actions are both optional, actions are enclosed in
braces to distinguish them from patterns.</p>
<h4 id="running-an-awk-program">Running an AWK Program</h4>
<p>There are several ways to run an awk program. You can type a command
line of the form</p>
<pre><code>awk &#39;<i>program</i>&#39; <i>input files</i></code></pre>
<p>to run the <i>program</i> on each of the specified input files. For
example, you could type</p>
<pre><code>awk &#39;$3 == 0 { print $1 }&#39; file1 file2</code></pre>
<p>to print the first field of every line of <code>file1</code> and
<code>file2</code> in which the third field is zero.</p>
<p>You can omit the input files from the command line and just type</p>
<pre><code>awk &#39;<i>program</i>&#39;</code></pre>
<p>In this case awk will apply the <i>program</i> to whatever you type
next on your terminal until you type an end-of-file signal (control-d on
Unix systems). Here is a sample of a session on Unix:</p>
<pre><code>$ awk &#39;$3 == 0 { print $1 }&#39;
Beth	4.00	0
<b>Beth</b>
Dan	3.75	0
<b>Dan</b>
Kathy	3.75	10
Kathy	3.75	0
<b>Kathy</b>
...</code></pre>
<p>The <code><b>heavy</b></code> characters are what the
computer printed.</p>
<p>This behavior makes it easy to experiment with awk: type your
program, then type data at it and see what happens. We again encourage
you to try the examples and variations on them.</p>
<p>Notice that the program is enclosed in single quotes on the command
line. This protects characters like <code>$</code> in the program from
being interpreted by the shell and also allows the program to be longer
than one line.</p>
<p>This arrangement is convenient when the program is short (a few
lines). If the program is long, however, it is more convenient to put it
into a separate file, say <code>progfile</code>, and type the command
line</p>
<pre><code>awk -f progfile <i>optional list of input files</i></code></pre>
<p>The <code>-f</code> option instructs awk to fetch the program from
the named file. Any filename can be used in place of
<code>progfile</code>.</p>
<h4 id="errors">Errors</h4>
<p>If you make an error in an awk program, awk will give you a
diagnostic message. For example, if you mistype a brace, like this:</p>
<pre><code>awk &#39;$3 == 0 [ print $1 }&#39; emp.data</code></pre>
<p>you will get a message like this:</p>
<pre><code>awk: syntax error at source line 1
 context is
	$3 == 0 &gt;&gt;&gt;  [ &lt;&lt;&lt;
	extra }
	missing ]
awk: bailing out at source line 1</code></pre>
<p>“Syntax error” means that you have made a grammatical error that was
detected at the place marked by <code>&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;</code>.
“Bailing out” means that no recovery was attempted. Sometimes you get a
little more help about what the error was, such as a report of
mismatched braces or parentheses.</p>
<p>Because of the syntax error, awk did not try to execute this program.
Some errors, however, may not be detected until your program is running.
For example, if you attempt to divide a number by zero, awk will stop
its processing and report the input line number and the line number in
the program at which the division was attempted.</p>
<h3 id="simple-output">1.2 Simple Output</h3>
<p>The rest of this chapter contains a collection of short, typical awk
programs based on manipulation of the <code>emp.data</code> file above.
We’ll explain briefly what’s going on, but these examples are meant
mainly to suggest useful operations that are easy to do with awk —
printing fields, selecting input, and transforming data. We are not
showing everything that awk can do by any means, nor are we going into
many details about the specific things presented here. But by the end of
this chapter, you will be able to accomplish quite a bit, and you’ll
find it much easier to read the later chapters.</p>
<p>We will usually show just the program, not the whole command line. In
every case, the program can be run either by enclosing it in quotes as
the first argument of the <code>awk</code> command, as shown above, or
by putting it in a file and invoking awk on that file with the
<code>-f</code> option.</p>
<p>There are only two types of data in awk: numbers and strings of
characters. The <code>emp.data</code> file is typical of this kind of
information — a mixture of words and numbers separated by blanks and/or
tabs.</p>
<p>Awk reads its input one line at a time and splits each line into
fields, where, by default, a field is a sequence of characters that
doesn’t contain any blanks or tabs. The first field in the current input
line is called <code>$1</code>, the second <code>$2</code>, and so
forth. The entire line is called <code>$0</code>. The number of fields
can vary from line to line.</p>
<p>Often, all we need to do is print some or all of the fields of each
line, perhaps performing some calculations. The programs in this section
are all of that form.</p>
<h4 id="printing-every-line">Printing Every Line</h4>
<p>If an action has no pattern, the action is performed for all input
lines. The statement <code>print</code> by itself prints the current
input line, so the program</p>
<pre><code>{ print }</code></pre>
<p>prints all of its input on the standard output. Since <code>$0</code>
is the whole line,</p>
<pre><code>{ print $0 }</code></pre>
<p>does the same thing.</p>
<h4 id="printing-certain-fields">Printing Certain Fields</h4>
<p>More than one item can be printed on the same output line with a
single <code>print</code> statement. The program to print the first and
third fields of each input line is</p>
<pre><code>{ print $1, $3 }</code></pre>
<p>With <code>emp.data</code> as input, it produces</p>
<pre><code>Beth 0
Dan 0
Kathy 10
Mark 20
Mary 22
Susie 18</code></pre>
<p>Expressions separated by a comma in a <code>print</code> statement
are, by default, separated by a single blank when they are printed. Each
line produced by <code>print</code> ends with a newline character. Both
of these defaults can be changed; we’ll show how in Chapter 2.</p>
<h4 id="nf-the-number-of-fields">NF, the Number of Fields</h4>
<p>It might appear you must always refer to fields as <code>$1</code>,
<code>$2</code>, and so on, but any expression can be used after
<code>$</code> to denote a field number; the expression is evaluated and
its numeric value is used as the field number. Awk counts the number of
fields in the current input line and stores the count in a built-in
variable called <code>NF</code>. Thus, the program</p>
<pre><code>{ print NF, $1, $NF }</code></pre>
<p>prints the number of fields and the first and last fields of each
input line.</p>
<h4 id="computing-and-printing">Computing and Printing</h4>
<p>You can also do computations on the field values and include the
results in what is printed. The program</p>
<pre><code>{ print $1, $2 * $3 }</code></pre>
<p>is a typical example. It prints the name and total pay (rate times
hours) for each employee:</p>
<pre><code>Beth 0
Dan 0
Kathy 40
Mark 100
Mary 121
Susie 76.5</code></pre>
<p>We’ll show in a moment how to make this output look better.</p>
<h4 id="printing-line-numbers">Printing Line Numbers</h4>
<p>Awk provides another built-variable, called <code>NR</code>, that
counts the number of lines read so far. We can use <code>NR</code> and
<code>$0</code> to prefix each line of <code>emp.data</code> with its
line number:</p>
<pre><code>{ print NR, $0 }</code></pre>
<p>The output looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>1 Beth	4.00	0
2 Dan	3.75	0
3 Kathy	4.00	10
4 Mark	5.00	20
5 Mary	5.50	22
6 Susie	4.25	18</code></pre>
<h4 id="putting-text-in-the-output">Putting Text in the Output</h4>
<p>You can also print words in the midst of fields and computed
values:</p>
<pre><code>{ print &quot;total pay for&quot;, $1, &quot;is&quot;, $2 * $3 }</code></pre>
<p>prints</p>
<pre><code>total pay for Beth is 0
total pay for Dan is 0
total pay for Kathy is 40
total pay for Mark is 100
total pay for Mary is 121
total pay for Susie is 76.5</code></pre>
<p>In the <code>print</code> statement, the text inside the double
quotes is printed along with the fields and computed values.</p>
<h3 id="fancier-output">1.3 Fancier Output</h3>
<p>The <code>print</code> statement is meant for quick and easy output.
To format the output exactly the way you want it, you may have to use
the <code>printf</code> statement. As we shall see in Section 2.4,
<code>printf</code> can produce almost any kind of output, but in this
section we’ll only show a few of its capabilities.</p>
<h4 id="lining-up-fields">Lining Up Fields</h4>
<p>The <code>printf</code> statement has the form</p>
<pre><code>printf(<i>format</i>, <i>value</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>value</i><sub>2</sub>, ... , <i>value</i><sub><i>n</i></sub>)</code></pre>
<p>where <i>format</i> is a string that contains text to be printed
verbatim, interspersed with specifications of how each of the values is
to be printed. A specification is a <code>%</code> followed by a few
characters that control the format of a <i>value</i>. The first
specification tells how <i>value</i><sub>1</sub> is to be printed, the second
how <i>value</i><sub>2</sub> is to be printed, and so on. Thus, there must be as
many <code>%</code> specifications in <i>format</i> as <i>values</i>
to be printed.</p>
<p>Here’s a program that uses <code>printf</code> to print the total pay
for every employee:</p>
<pre><code>{ printf(&quot;total pay for %s is $%.2f\n&quot;, $1, $2 * $3) }</code></pre>
<p>The specification string in the <code>printf</code> statement
contains two <code>%</code> specifications.</p>
<p>The first, <code>%s</code>, says to print the first value,
<code>$1</code>, as a string of characters; the second,
<code>%.2f</code>, says to print the second value, <code>$2*$3</code>,
as a number with 2 digits after the decimal point. Everything else in
the specification string, including the dollar sign, is printed
verbatim; the <code>\n</code> at the end of the string stands for a
newline, which causes subsequent output to begin on the next line. With
<code>emp.data</code> as input, this program yields:</p>
<pre><code>total pay for Beth is $0.00
total pay for Dan is $0.00
total pay for Kathy is $40.00
total pay for Mark is $100.00
total pay for Mary is $121.00
total pay for Susie is $76.50</code></pre>
<p>With <code>printf</code>, no blanks or newlines are produced
automatically; you must create them yourself. Don’t forget the
<code>\n</code>.</p>
<p>Here’s another program that prints each employee’s name and pay:</p>
<pre><code>{ printf(&quot;%-8s $%6.2f\n&quot;, $1, $2 * $3) }</code></pre>
<p>The first specification, <code>%-8s</code>, prints a name as a string
of characters leftjustified in a field 8 characters wide. The second
specification, <code>%6.2f</code>, prints the pay as a number with two
digits after the decimal point, in a field 6 characters wide:</p>
<pre><code>Beth     $  0.00
Dan      $  0.00
Kathy    $ 40.00
Mark     $100.00
Mary     $121.00
Susie    $ 76.50</code></pre>
<p>We’ll show lots more examples of <code>printf</code> as we go along;
the full story is in Section 2.4.</p>
<h4 id="sorting-the-output">Sorting the Output</h4>
<p>Suppose you want to print all the data for each employee, along with
his or her pay, sorted in order of increasing pay. The easiest way is to
use awk to prefix the total pay to each employee record, and run that
output through a sorting program. On Unix, the command line</p>
<pre><code>awk &#39;{ printf(&quot;%6.2f  %s\n&quot;, $2 * $3, $0) }&#39; emp.data | sort</code></pre>
<p>pipes the output of awk into the <code>sort</code> command, and
produces:</p>
<pre><code>  0.00  Beth	4.00	0
  0.00  Dan	3.75	0
 40.00  Kathy	4.00	10
 76.50  Susie	4.25	18
100.00  Mark	5.00	20
121.00  Mary	5.50	22</code></pre>
<h3 id="selection">1.4 Selection</h3>
<p>Awk patterns are good for selecting interesting lines from the input
for further processing. Since a pattern without an action prints all
lines matching the pattern, many awk programs consist of nothing more
than a single pattern. This section gives some examples of useful
patterns.</p>
<h4 id="selection-by-comparison">Selection by Comparison</h4>
<p>This program uses a comparison pattern to select the records of
employees who earn $5.00 or more per hour, that is, lines in which the
second field is greater than or equal to 5:</p>
<pre><code>$2 &gt;= 5</code></pre>
<p>It selects these lines from <code>emp.data</code>:</p>
<pre><code>Mark	5.00	20
Mary	5.50	22</code></pre>
<h4 id="selection-by-computation">Selection by Computation</h4>
<p>The program</p>
<pre><code>$2 * $3 &gt; 50 { printf(&quot;$%.2f for %s\n&quot;, $2 * $3, $1) }</code></pre>
<p>prints the pay of those employees whose total pay exceeds $50:</p>
<pre><code>$100.00 for Mark
$121.00 for Mary
$76.50 for Susie</code></pre>
<h4 id="selection-by-text-content">Selection by Text Content</h4>
<p>Besides numeric tests, you can select input lines that contain
specific words or phrases. This program prints all lines in which the
first field is <code>Susie</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$1 == &quot;Susie&quot;</code></pre>
<p>The operator <code>==</code> tests for equality. You can also look
for text containing any of a set of letters, words, and phrases by using
patterns called <em>regular expressions</em>. This program prints all
lines that contain <code>Susie</code> anywhere:</p>
<pre><code>/Susie/</code></pre>
<p>The output is this line:</p>
<pre><code>Susie	4.25	18</code></pre>
<p>Regular expressions can be used to specify much more elaborate
patterns; Section 2.1 contains a full discussion.</p>
<h4 id="combinations-of-patterns">Combinations of Patterns</h4>
<p>Patterns can be combined with parentheses and the logical operators
<code>&amp;&amp;</code>, <code>||</code>, and <code>!</code>, which
stand for AND, OR, and NOT. The program</p>
<pre><code>$2 &gt;= 4 || $3 &gt;= 20</code></pre>
<p>prints those lines where <code>$2</code> is at least 4 <em>or</em>
<code>$3</code> is at least 20:</p>
<pre><code>Beth	4.00	0
Kathy	4.00	10
Mark	5.00	20
Mary	5.50	22
Susie	4.25	18</code></pre>
<p>Lines that satisfy both conditions are printed only once. Contrast
this with the following program, which consists of two patterns:</p>
<pre><code>$2 &gt;= 4
$3 &gt;= 20</code></pre>
<p>This program prints an input line twice if it satisfies both
conditions:</p>
<pre><code>Beth	4.00	0
Kathy	4.00	10
Mark	5.00	20
Mark	5.00	20
Mary	5.50	22
Mary	5.50	22
Susie	4.25	18</code></pre>
<p>Note that the program</p>
<pre><code>!($2 &lt; 4 &amp;&amp; $3 &lt; 20)</code></pre>
<p>prints lines where it is <em>not</em> true that <code>$2</code> is
less than 4 <em>and</em> <code>$3</code> is less than 20; this condition
is equivalent to the first one above, though perhaps less readable.</p>
<h4 id="data-validation">Data Validation</h4>
<p>There are always errors in real data. Awk is an excellent tool for
checking that data has reasonable values and is in the right format, a
task that is often called <em>data validation</em>.</p>
<p>Data validation is essentially negative: instead of printing lines
with desirable properties, one prints lines that are suspicious. The
following program uses comparison patterns to apply five plausibility
tests to each line of <code>emp.data</code>:</p>
<pre><code>NF != 3   { print $0, &quot;number of fields is not equal to 3&quot; }
$2 &lt; 3,35 { print $0, &quot;rate is below minimum wage&quot; }
$2 &gt; 10   { print $0, &quot;rate exceeds $10 per hour&quot; }
$3 &lt; 0    { print $0, &quot;negative hours worked&quot; }
$3 &gt; 60   { print $0, &quot;too many hours worked&quot; }</code></pre>
<p>If there are no errors, there’s no output.</p>
<h4 id="begin-and-end">BEGIN and END</h4>
<p>The special pattern <code>BEGIN</code> matches before the first line
of the first input file is read, and <code>END</code> matches after the
last line of the last file has been processed. This program uses
<code>BEGIN</code> to print a heading:</p>
<pre><code>BEGIN { print &quot;NAME    RATE   HOURS&quot;; print &quot;&quot; }
      { print }</code></pre>
<p>The output is:</p>
<pre><code>NAME    RATE   HOURS

Beth	4.00	0
Dan	3.75	0
Kathy	4.00	10
Mark	5.00	20
Mary	5.50	22
Susie	4.25	18</code></pre>
<p>You can put several statements on a single line if you separate them
by semicolons. Notice that <code>print ""</code> prints a blank line,
quite different from just plain <code>print</code>, which prints the
current input line.</p>
<h3 id="computing-with-awk">1 .5 Computing with AWK</h3>
<p>An action is a sequence of statements separated by newlines or
semicolons. You have already seen examples in which the action was a
single <code>print</code> statement. This section provides examples of
statements for performing simple numeric and string computations. In
these statements you can use not only the built-in variables like
<code>NF</code>, but you can create your own variables for performing
calculations, storing data, and the like. In awk, user-created variables
are not declared.</p>
<h4 id="counting">Counting</h4>
<p>This program uses a variable <code>emp</code> to count employees who
have worked more than 15 hours:</p>
<pre><code>$3 &gt; 15 { emp = emp + 1 }
END     { print emp, &quot;employees worked more than 15 hours&quot; }</code></pre>
<p>For every line in which the third field exceeds 15, the previous
value of <code>emp</code> is incremented by 1. With
<code>emp.data</code> as input, this program yields:</p>
<pre><code>3 employees worked more than 15 hours</code></pre>
<p>Awk variables used as numbers begin life with the value 0, so we
didn’t need to initialize <code>emp</code>.</p>
<h4 id="computing-sums-and-averages">Computing Sums and Averages</h4>
<p>To count the number of employees, we can use the built-in variable
<code>NR</code>, which holds the number of lines read so far; its value
at the end of all input is the total number of lines read.</p>
<pre><code>END { print NR, &quot;employees&quot; }</code></pre>
<p>The output is:</p>
<pre><code>6 employees</code></pre>
<p>Here is a program that uses <code>NR</code> to compute the average
pay:</p>
<pre><code>    { pay = pay + $2 * $3 }
END { print NR, &quot;employees&quot;
      print &quot;total pay is&quot;, pay
      print &quot;average pay is&quot;, pay/NR
    }</code></pre>
<p>The first action accumulates the total pay for all employees. The
<code>END</code> action prints</p>
<pre><code>6 employees
total pay is 337.5
average pay is 56.25</code></pre>
<p>Clearly, <code>printf</code> could be used to produce neater output.
There’s also a potential error: in the unlikely case that
<code>NR</code> is zero, the program will attempt to divide by zero and
thus will generate an error message.</p>
<h4 id="handling-text">Handling Text</h4>
<p>One of the strengths of awk is its ability to handle strings of
characters as conveniently as most languages handle numbers. Awk
variables can hold strings of characters as well as numbers. This
program finds the employee who is paid the most per hour:</p>
<pre><code>$2 &gt; maxrate { maxrate = $2; maxemp = $1 }
END { print &quot;highest hourly rate:&quot;, maxrate, &quot;for&quot;, maxemp }</code></pre>
<p>It prints</p>
<pre><code>highest hourly rate: 5.50 for Mary</code></pre>
<p>In this program the variable <code>maxrate</code> holds a numeric
value, while the variable <code>maxemp</code> holds a string. (If there
are several employees who all make the same maximum pay, this program
finds only the first.)</p>
<h4 id="string-concatenation">String Concatenation</h4>
<p>New strings may be created by combining old ones; this operation is
called <em>concatenation</em>. The program</p>
<pre><code>    { names = names $1 &quot; &quot; }
END { print names }</code></pre>
<p>collects all the employee names into a single string, by appending
each name and a blank to the previous value in the variable
<code>names</code>. The value of <code>names</code> is printed by the
<code>END</code> action:</p>
<pre><code>Beth Dan Kathy Mark Mary Susie</code></pre>
<p>The concatenation operation is represented in an awk program by
writing string values one after the other. At every input line, the
first statement in the program concatenates three strings: the previous
value of <code>names</code>, the first field, and a blank; it then
assigns the resulting string to <code>names</code>. Thus, after all
input lines have been read, <code>names</code> contains a single string
consisting of the names of all the employees, each followed by a blank.
Variables used to store strings begin life holding the null string (that
is, the string containing no characters), so in this program
<code>names</code> did not need to be explicitly initialized.</p>
<h4 id="printing-the-last-input-line">Printing the Last Input Line</h4>
<p>Although <code>NR</code> retains its value in an <code>END</code>
action, <code>$0</code> does not. The program</p>
<pre><code>    { last = $0 }
END { print last }</code></pre>
<p>is one way to print the last input line:</p>
<pre><code>Susie	4.25	18</code></pre>
<h4 id="built-in-functions">Built-in Functions</h4>
<p>We have already seen that awk provides built-in variables that
maintain frequently used quantities like the number of fields and the
input line number. Similarly, there are built-in functions for computing
other useful values. Besides arithmetic functions for square roots,
logarithms, random numbers, and the like, there are also functions that
manipulate text. One of these is <code>length</code>, which counts the
number of characters in a string. For example, this program computes the
length of each person’s name:</p>
<pre><code>{ print $1, length($1) }</code></pre>
<p>The result:</p>
<pre><code>Beth 4
Dan 3
Kathy 5
Mark 4
Mary 4
Susie 5</code></pre>
<h4 id="counting-lines-words-and-characters">Counting Lines, Words, and
Characters</h4>
<p>This program uses <code>length</code>, <code>NF</code>, and
<code>NR</code> to count the number of lines, words, and characters in
the input. For convenience, we’ll treat each field as a word.</p>
<pre><code>    { nc = nc + length($0) + 1
      nw = nw + NF
    }
END { print NR, &quot;lines,&quot;, nw, &quot;words,&quot;, nc, &quot;characters&quot; }</code></pre>
<p>The file <code>emp.data</code> has</p>
<pre><code>6 lines, 18 words, 77 characters</code></pre>
<p>We have added one for the newline character at the end of each input
line, since <code>$0</code> doesn’t include it.</p>
<h3 id="control-flow-statements">1.6 Control-Flow Statements</h3>
<p>Awk provides an <code>if-else</code> statement for making decisions
and several statements for writing loops, all modeled on those found in
the C programming language. They can only be used in actions.</p>
<h4 id="if-else-statement">If-Else Statement</h4>
<p>The following program computes the total and average pay of employees
making more than $6.00 an hour. It uses an <code>if</code> to defend
against division by zero in computing the average pay.</p>
<pre><code>$2 &gt; 6 { n = n + 1; pay = pay + $2 * $3 }
END    { if (n &gt; 0)
             print n, &quot;employees, total pay is&quot;, pay,
                      &quot;average pay is&quot;, pay/n
         else
             print &quot;no employees are paid more than $6/hour&quot;
       }</code></pre>
<p>The output for <code>emp.data</code> is:</p>
<pre><code>no employees are paid more than $6/hour</code></pre>
<p>In the <code>if-else</code> statement, the condition following the
<code>if</code> is evaluated. If it is true, the first
<code>print</code> statement is performed. Otherwise, the second
<code>print</code> statement is performed. Note that we can continue a
long statement over several lines by breaking it after a comma.</p>
<h4 id="while-statement">While Statement</h4>
<p>A <code>while</code> statement has a condition and a body. The
statements in the body are performed repeatedly while the condition is
true. This program shows how the value of an amount of money invested at
a particular interest rate grows over a number of years, using the
formula <i>value</i> = <i>amount</i> (1 +
<i>rate</i>)<sup><i>years</i></sup>.</p>
<pre><code># interest 1 - compute compound interest
#   input:  amount  rate  years
#   output: compounded value at the end of each year

{   i = 1
    while (i &lt;= $3) {
        printf(&quot;\t%.2f\n&quot;, $1 * (1 + $2) ^ i)
        i = i + 1
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>The condition is the parenthesized expression after the
<code>while</code>; the loop body is the two statements enclosed in
braces after the condition. The <code>\t</code> in the
<code>printf</code> specification string stands for a tab character; the
<code>^</code> is the exponentiation operator. Text from a
<code>#</code> to the end of the line is a <em>comment</em>, which is
ignored by awk but should be helpful to readers of the program who want
to understand what is going on.</p>
<p>You can type triplets of numbers at this program to see what various
amounts, rates, and years produce. For example, this transaction shows
how $1000 grows at 6% and 12% compound interest for five years:</p>
<pre><code>$ awk -f interest1
1000 .06 5
	1060.00
	1123.60
	1191.02
	1262.48
	1338.23
1000 .12 5
	1120.00
	1254.40
	1404.93
	1573.52
	1762.34</code></pre>
<h4 id="for-statement">For Statement</h4>
<p>Another statement, <code>for</code>, compresses into a single line
the initialization, test, and increment that are part of most loops.
Here is the previous interest computation with a <code>for</code>:</p>
<pre><code># interest2 - compute compound interest
#   input:  amount  rate  years
#   output: compounded value at the end of each year

{   for (i = 1; i &lt;= $3; i = i + 1)
        printf (&quot;\t%.2f\n&quot;, $1 * (1 + $2) ^ i)
}</code></pre>
<p>The initialization <code>i = 1</code> is performed once. Next, the
condition <code>i &lt;= $3</code> is tested; if it is true, the
<code>printf</code> statement, which is the body of the loop, is
performed. Then the increment <code>i = i + 1</code> is performed after
the body, and the next iteration of the loop begins with another test of
the condition. The code is more compact, and since the body of the loop
is only a single statement, no braces are needed to enclose it.</p>
<h3 id="arrays">1.7 Arrays</h3>
<p>Awk provides arrays for storing groups of related values. Although
arrays give awk considerable power, we will show only a simple example
here. The following program prints its input in reverse order by line.
The first action puts the input lines into successive elements of the
array <code>line</code>; that is, the first line goes into
<code>line[1]</code>, the second line into <code>line[2]</code>, and
so on. The <code>END</code> action uses a <code>while</code> statement
to print the lines from the array from last to first:</p>
<pre><code># reverse - print input in reverse order by line

    { line[NR] = $0 }  # remember each input line

END { i = NR           # print lines in reverse order
      while (i &gt; 0) {
          print line[i]
          i = i - 1
      }
    }</code></pre>
<p>With <code>emp.data</code>, the output is</p>
<pre><code>Susie	4.25	18
Mary	5.50	22
Mark	5.00	20
Kathy	4.00	10
Dan	3.75	0
Beth	4.00	0</code></pre>
<p>Here is the same example with a <code>for</code> statement:</p>
<pre><code># reverse - print input in reverse order by line

    { line[NR] = $0 }  # remember each input line

END { for (i = NR; i &gt; 0; i = i - 1)
          print line[i]
    }</code></pre>
<h3 id="a-handful-of-useful-one-liners">1.8 A Handful of Useful
“One-liners”</h3>
<p>Although awk can be used to write programs of some complexity, many
useful programs are not much more complicated than what we’ve seen so
far. Here is a collection of short programs that you might find handy
and/or instructive. Most are variations on material already covered.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Print the total number of input lines:
<pre><code>END { print NR }</code></pre></li>
<li>Print the tenth input line:
<pre><code>NR == 10</code></pre></li>
<li>Print the last field of every input line:
<pre><code>{ print $NF }</code></pre></li>
<li>Print the last field of the last input line:
<pre><code>    { field = $NF}
END { print field }</code></pre></li>
<li>Print every input line with more than four fields:
<pre><code>NF &gt; 4</code></pre></li>
<li>Print every input line in which the last field is more than 4:
<pre><code>$NF &gt; 4</code></pre></li>
<li>Print the total number of fields in all input lines:
<pre><code>    { nf = nf + NF }
END { print nf }</code></pre></li>
<li>Print the total number of lines that contain <code>Beth</code>:
<pre><code>/Beth/ { nlines = nlines + 1 }
END    { print nlines }</code></pre></li>
<li>Print the largest first field and the line that contains it (assumes
some <code>$1</code> is positive):
<pre><code>$1 &gt; max { max = $1; maxline = $0 }
END      { print max, maxline }</code></pre></li>
<li>Print every line that has at least one field:
<pre><code>NF &gt; 0</code></pre></li>
<li>Print every line longer than 80 characters:
<pre><code>length($0) &gt; 80</code></pre></li>
<li>Print the number of fields in every line followed by the line
itself:
<pre><code>{ print NF, $0 }</code></pre></li>
<li>Print the first two fields, in opposite order, of every line:
<pre><code>{ print $2, $1 }</code></pre></li>
<li>Exchange the first two fields of every line and then print the line:
<pre><code>{ temp = $1; $1 = $2; $2 = temp; print }</code></pre></li>
<li>Print every line with the first field replaced by the line number:
<pre><code>{ $1 = NR; print }</code></pre></li>
<li>Print every line after erasing the second field:
<pre><code>{ $2 = ""; print }</code></pre></li>
<li>Print in reverse order the fields of every line:
<pre><code>{ for (i = NF; i &gt; 0; i = i - 1) printf("%s " , $i)
  printf ("\n")
}</code></pre></li>
<li>Print the sums of the fields of every line:
<pre><code>{ sum = 0
  for (i = 1; i &lt;= NF; i = i + 1) sum = sum + $i
  print sum
}</code></pre></li>
<li>Add up all fields in all lines and print the sum:
<pre><code>    { for (i = 1; i &lt;= NF; i = i + 1) sum = sum + $i }
END { print sum }</code></pre></li>
<li>Print every line after replacing each field by its absolute value:
<pre><code>{ for (i = 1; i &lt;= NF; i = i + 1) if ($i &lt; 0) $i = -$i
  print
}</code></pre></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="what-next">1.9 What Next?</h3>
<p>You have now seen the essentials of awk. Each program in this chapter
has been a sequence of pattern-action statements. Awk tests every input
line against the patterns, and when a pattern matches, performs the
corresponding action. Patterns can involve numeric and string
comparisons, and actions can include computation and formatted printing.
Besides reading through your input files automatically, awk splits each
input line into fields. It also provides a number of built-in variables
and functions, and lets you define your own as well. With this
combination of features, quite a few useful computations can be
expressed by short programs — many of the details that would be needed
in another language are handled implicitly in an awk program.</p>
<p>The rest of the book elaborates on these basic ideas. Since some of
the examples are quite a bit bigger than anything in this chapter, we
encourage you strongly to begin writing programs as soon as possible.
This will give you familiarity with the language and make it easier to
understand the larger programs. Furthermore, nothing answers questions
so well as some simple experiments. You should also browse through the
whole book; each example conveys something about the language, either
about how to use a particular feature, or how to create an interesting
program.</p>
