  <h1>heat</h1>
    <p>the cycloptic arcade machine returns your blank stare. both of you have been awake too long, eyes bulging, expectant, glaring white text  mutually burned into your phosphor retinas.</p>
<p>“<code>0 credits</code>”, she explains.</p>
<p>“no money” you concur, in your own tongue.</p>
<p>a woman chews a goodnight through a pen lid as you leave. it’s not raining outside, but it should be – looking up you feel the static electricity of raindrops on your cheeks, but they never arrive. just another backlit black screen, and the mosquito-pitch of the crt still whining in your ears.</p>
<p>the night is hot. an uncomfortable reminder of your human form and its propensity to sweat, tiny pricks through skin under your clothes, perhaps some of them are real mosquitoes too. glancing up and down the road, it’s quiet, just ambient sirens, empty pavement lit in sodium yellow. you take off your tshirt, a black sports bra underneath. stuffy turbulence against the small of your back is an improvement.</p>
<p>your route home passes by the dog who hates trans people. their snout is visible even from a block away - same as always, sticking out at ground level from between the bars in the fence, vigilant, warning. their barking could easily wake the whole neighborhood at this time of night. that dog <em>really</em> fucking hates trannies. the elderly st bernard raises one heavy eyelid as you pass, mustering a disapproving gurgle and a huff before returning to their dream.</p>
<p>the flat above yours is throwing a party. muffled voices carry to street level through sliding doors, a pair giggling into each other on the balcony. you unclip your keys from your belt. suddenly you’re startled by the sound of metal crunching behind you, and a sticky spray up the backs of your legs.</p>
<p>the half-empty monster can rolls to a stop at the edge of the curb.</p>
<p>whatever. you needed a <a href="shower.html">shower</a> anyway.</p>
