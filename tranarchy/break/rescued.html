  <h1>my words</h1>
    <p>“you know how the subtitle for frankenstein was the modern prometheus? do you think you could write a susan stryker-esque piece about transmasculinity as like, the non-modern prometheus”</p>
<p>“above the village of uh, chamaizi or something?”</p>
<p>“hm no okay that was a bad idea. idk i just feel like lots of modern interpretations of prometheus use him in a purified rationalist way, as like, god of the enlightenment. which sucks double because on one side you get like, logic bros valorizing him for being moral and intellectual and on the other side you get people grumbling about how you shouldn’t mess with the natural order of things. like, it just misses the part where he’s a little goblin brat who loves pain and doing shit he’s not supposed to. cis people just don’t understand greek myths”</p>
<p>“one must imagine prometheus dripping wet and blushing <em>hard</em>”</p>
<p>“oh absolutely, that man is <a href="soaked.html">soaked</a> through his loincloth”</p>
