  <h1>cabins</h1>
    <p>you turn the handle on the door closest to you and peek inside.</p>
<p>the room is lit by a single electron tube on a side-table, giving the room an intimate warmth. on the lower bunk, two crewmen are fucking: a stout droid with well-rounded thighs rides atop a tall, slender droid reclining on his back, grasping the rider’s hip firmly with strong fingers. both of them are wearing only socks, muttering profanities under their breath.</p>
<p>the creaking of the slats hides the sound of the door, and neither notices you observing their embrace for a few moments, until the reclining droid opens his eyes. he looks you up and down and smiles leeringly.</p>
<p>“care to join lad, or you just gona keep drooling?”</p>
<p>the bottom looks confused, then turns to see you in the doorway. he shoots an unamused glance at his partner, turns back to you, and pushes the door firmly shut in your face.</p>
