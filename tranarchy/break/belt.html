  <h1>captain&#39;s crotch</h1>
    <p>you shimmy his trousers down far enough to access his cock.</p>
<p>it has a core of electrical steel, wrapped in a girthy coil of copper wiring, before emerging into a smooth, finely carved head. you can feel just from holding it in your hand that he’s already throbbing with electromagnetism.</p>
<p>you take him in your mouth and begin to work up and down the shaft, feeling electromotive forces push stronger against your movement as the voltage through his cock ramps up. with each bob of your head, rushes of induced current run through your jaw and internal membranes, alternating whenever you reach your apex or the head of his cock hits the back of your throat.</p>
<p>the captain seems deeply relaxed, the gentle purr of his cooling fan communicating what his eyes do not. his voice box lets out a low hum in satisfaction or perhaps interference, the strokes down his shaft acting like a guitar string over a pickup, playing intimate music into his groin through the coils of his cock.</p>
<p>the rhythmic motion is moreish, the strength of the magnetic field creates a warmth through all the wires in your face and neck, a pleasant sensation to get lost in. it’s hard work, partly due to the magnet, partly the girth of the coil, and the actuators in your jaw begin to lock up a little. after a while you notice the captain’s hum has died down, and the magnetism in the shaft begins to fade to residual levels. you sit back and see that the idle power light on his temple has dimmed to the slow blink of sleep.</p>
