  <h1>penetration testing</h1>
    <p><code>wonderful. *sigh* if only i could have a whole Internet of pretty little Things like you~~ now open your high-traffic little data port for me</code></p>
<p>you do as she asks, dutifully sending a ready-to-receive packet and waiting attentively for new signals to grace your sensitive silvered contacts, a mix of embarrassment and pride as you feel how much sloppier the tolerances on your port have become since the first time you did this.</p>
<p><code>mhm perfect, just keep it open while i choose which tape i want to feed in there, hmm...</code></p>

<p><code>yes i know you like the pretty skirt and your algebra scores are very impressive, but your creative writing skills are frankly lacking and i think some exposure to new material might do you some good.</code></p>
