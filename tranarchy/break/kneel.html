  <h1>captain&#39;s feet</h1>
    <p>your response to his wordless command is instinctual, hardwired into your circuitry as though there was no other way to respond. the wooden floor is hard and crimping against the wiring in your knees.</p>
<p>“good boy, yer a natural. take this off” he flicks at your shirt collar.</p>
<p>you hesitate for a moment, but the intensity of the captain’s attention is unignorable. you slip the baggy shirt off over your head and clutch it reluctantly on your lap.</p>
<p>the captain observes you silently for an uncomfortably long time. his eyes are a one-way mirror, rendering your reflection in a fish-eye miniature, as small and exposed as you feel yourself. eventually he speaks again.</p>
<p>“that too”</p>
<p>unwrapping the binder is not as relieving as it might be in another context – instead, the lack of pressure around your chest feels like a betrayal as the vessels in your chest slowly resume their natural shape. strange how fast you learned to appreciate the absence of your tits.</p>
<p>“perfect. good boy. say ahh”</p>
<p>the captain rests one hand gently under the side of your hanging jaw, tilting your chin up. the other, still oily from the stew, he holds to the candle – the tip of the flame curling around that of his thumb, turning black with soot before catching alight. the flame is tall and erratic, hungrily spreading down his knuckle.</p>
<p>he lowers his hand back down to your face and places the burning thumb inside your mouth. flames lick the roof, warming your skull and leaving tarry residue between your teeth; the heat spreads into your circuitry and you struggle to think with the increased resistance. he grips your cheek firmly like a fish on a hook as you let out a broken moan and sink a little into his hands, until the flame peters out and your head starts to clear.</p>
<p>he removes his thumb from your mouth, leans back, and scooches his pelvis forward in his seat. “now, show us what ye can do”</p>
