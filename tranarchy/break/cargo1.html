  <h1>cargo</h1>
    <p>after peeking into several barrels of unidentified fluids, you find the lemons. the barrel is too heavy to lift, so you fill a large basket. better to take too many than to be sent for more.</p>
<p>as you head back toward the stairs with the basket in both hands, the carpenter comes down to fetch some scraps of wood. he’s tall, with a slim steam-driven musculature, both sleeves cuffed at the elbows showing polished engravings across his forearms. he seems well-kempt, with a spritely look in his eyes – quite handsome, even.</p>
<p>“droid slipped overboard”, he explains in dulcet, breathy voice. “crashed through a railing on the way out”.</p>
<p>you shake your head in sympathetic exasperation as you shuffle awkwardly past him to carry the heavy basket up the stairs.</p>
<p>halfway up, you feel a sharp smack on your ass, and stumble forward into the staircase, lemons bouncing down the steps. the carpenter laughs, a short switch of wood in his right hand and a bundle in the other.</p>
<p>“sorry, couldn’t resist… ye’ve got an arse, for a boy. here, i’ll help you with these”</p>
<p>he sets his planks down and bends to pick the lemons up off the floor with a graceful motion, returning them in an armful to the pile. then he circles behind you, reaching around your small frame to help lift the basket, his deft fingers curling around yours. he’s a firm presence against your back, the linen wrap and clothing softening the contact of his smooth brass torso, and the warmth of his core breathing life gently down your spine. as he lifts, steam sighs from his mouth close to your ear, and you let out a little whine, hurriedly disguising it into a noise of exertion.</p>
<p>he sets you and the basket down at the top of the stairs. “you don’t talk much, eh lad?”</p>
<p>cheeks glowing faintly from heat, you shake your head. the carpenter dips back down into the cargo hold, whistling a tune from his release valves.</p>
