    <p>“yeah! like prometheus. although, i’m hoping i don’t get quite as much liver damage”</p>
<p>“pfffhahaha fuck, omg wait, i think the greeks had a thing where they thought that the liver was where ur emotions were stored, so actually there’s lev-”</p>
<p>“do you think that prometheus had tboy swag”</p>
<p>“oh hmmmmmmmmmm yes and i think any depictions of him that don’t acknowledge this are wrong. but it’s not because of the eternal punishment part. like,, the stuff that he did <em>in order to</em> get punished? that’s got tboy written all over it, it’s cocky and mischievous. but i don’t really know of… wait,”</p>
<p>“you don’t know of any tboys who would like to get punished eternally?”</p>
<p>“is this why tboys do this? was prometheus just a brat? tbh i’ve always looked at prometheus and kinda seen myself in him, in that i feel like it’d be soooo fucking romantic to be eternally punished for real, not even for brat reasons, just like, because the image of it is so maddeningly wounded and raw and, and, it’s such a good story can you imagine telling people the tale of how you came to be chained to the rock in endless agony? i would love it”</p>
<p>“the feminine urge to be indefinitely bound to a rock”</p>
<p>“yeah and then i get <a href="rescued.html">rescued</a> by a big strong man! it’s literally all i could ever ask for”</p>
