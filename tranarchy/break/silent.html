  <h1>boy</h1>
    <p>the voice lumbers down the stairs.</p>
<p>“ah there y’are, what’s got into you? a cabin-boy’s no use if he won’t come when called!”</p>
<p>confused and indignant, you pipe up, “but, i’m not a boy? you must be looking for someone else”</p>
<p>the figure scoffs derisively. “yeah, right, my sincerest apologies to the Big Strong Man dawdling in his hammock all day!” he grabs a fistful of your shirt, lifting you into the air and pinning your back against a nearby post almost effortlessly. you pray he hasn’t noticed your bindings, intimately aware that this man’s could crush you into greasy scrap without a second thought.</p>
<p>“yer a boy until ye can keep both feet on the ground around the real men. understand?”</p>
