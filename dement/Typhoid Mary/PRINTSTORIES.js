She pushes past the men sitting and drinking in the orange plastic swivel chairs. She goes behind the bar and through the door to the back room and dumps her bag on a table. The heavy bald man is there. <br/>"Hello." says Typhoid Mary. <br/>"Nngh." he says. <br/>Typhoid Mary takes her clothes off. She holds onto the table for support when she\'s getting out of her jeans. She knocks an ashtray off. "Ah shit." says Typhoid Mary. She has on white silk boxer shorts and a white cotton singlet. From her bag she takes black shiny army boots and a worn trench coat. She puts these on. She fastens a gold chain around the neck. She puts on black eyeliner and red lipstick without a mirror. She puts three different shades of lipstick and small latex lumps on the belly in spots like a typhoid rash. It looks inflamed. Woo Woo and Sharon arrive. They also undress. <br/>"Could you go out first for me love?" says Sharon. <br/>"Yes." says Typhoid Mary, "Hi Woo Woo." <br/>Woo Woo giggles.<br/>Typhoid Mary picks up the cassette from her bag and goes out to the bar. She gives it to the barman. He puts it into the sound system and plays it. The song is \'I\'m a Man\' by Muddy Waters. It has a chorus that goes "I\'m a MAN, man - child, that spelled M... A child, N..." The men in the chairs seem to know it. They smile. Two of the younger ones pretend to be playing  guitar. They scew up their faces, pout their lips, put their right hands on their cocks, left hands in the air and wiggle their fingers. The men turn their heads towards the bar. Typhoid Mary holds the trench coat closed and strides to the centre of the chairs. She stands still, looks around at the faces and jerks the coat open. She dances. Mostly she moves the hips and shoulders with the hands on the hips. She lets the coat drop down over the back. The song ends. She throws the coat at the men in the front row. The next song starts. It is "I\'m a Wonderful Thing Baby" by Kid Creole and the Coconuts. Typhoid Mary dances: pelvic thrusting, hands on the groin. The tits almost fall out the sides of the singlet. It is too large. She lifts the arms and does muscleman poses. The men in the audience swivel to follow her moves. Mostly their mouths are open grins and their hands are near their groins. Typhoid Mary shapes up like a <br/>boxer. She punches the air and ducks the head. She punches one man lightly on the chin. "Ow. Bitch. Stop that." he says. He laughs for his friends. <br/>Typhoid Mary keeps dancing. She pulls off the singlet and holds one end tight in each hand. She uses it like a towel behind the neck and down back and forth over the back and arse. She brings it fast over to the front again and wraps it hard around the neck of a man in the front row and pushes the typhoid rash into his face then rips the singlet away to  do the same to the next man in the row. They protest. She shakes her tits close to their noses. She runs a hand from the throat, over the left tit, squeezes the nipple between two fingers, and down to the rash. The Kid Creole song ends and Suzy Quatro \'s "I Wanna be your Man" starts up. Typhoid Mary lets go of the singlet. She presses one hand to the chest<br/><br/></span></div>'), script: (x) => {/**/}},

She spits. She goes to the coffee shop around the corner. She sits down and orders a coffee. A boy with the face of a dead film star and the moves of a dead friend, sits down next to her. <br/>"Typhus." she says and hugs him. <br/>"Hello Mary. How are you these days? What are you doing with yourself?" says the boy, Typhus, "It\'s been so long."<br/>"When did you get into town?" says Typhoid Mary. "It has been so long."<br/>"Let\'s go for a drive Mary. I have a new car." says the boy. <br/>Typhoid Mary leaves the coffee. The car is parked in an alley. It is a panel van, midnight blue with bits of chrome. <br/>"Ha Ha." says Typhoid Mary, "A panel van, a fuck truck. Ha ha. It makes me feel like I\'m a teenager again. Let\'s go parking."<br/>"Serious?" says Typhus. "Yes." says Typhoid Mary. <br/>They laugh and get in. They drive to a dark place by the water. There are other cars parked there. People in them are fucking. Typhoid Mary and Typhus talk. They haven\'t seen each other for a long time. They used to work the same place, years ago, in another town. They are friends.<br/>"Mary you look beautiful." says Typhus.<br/>"Not as beautiful as you." says Typhoid Mary. "Let\'s fuck."<br/>"I\'m contagious Mary." says Typhus.<br/>Typhoid Mary feels strong desire, as strong as madness, like breathing.<br/>"I know. It\'s OK. I am too." says Typhoid Mary. She shows him her latex rash.<br/>They fuck. Typhus drives her back to the strip club for the 1.00 am show. They fuck again in the car in the alley then Typhoid Mary goes in through the door of the club carrying her bag and does the second show. <br/><br/>Typhoid Mary works two shows on Thursdays and Fridays and three on Saturdays at the strip club. On Tuesdays she goes to therapy.<br/><br/>After the one o\'clock show Typhus is outside in the car. They fuck in the alley in the front of the car. He kneels on the floor. Typhoid Mary has her safety belt on. They drive around afterwards without getting dressed. They stop at the lights. People stare. They go back to Typhoid Mary\'s place. They fuck on the floor on a pile of furs. Typhus falls asleep there at Typhoid Mary\'s feet.<br/><br/>The next night after Typhoid Mary\'s last show, they drive to a small bay in a wealthy suburb. They walk down to the boatshed. They take a row boat and row out between the yachts. Some seagulls are woken up. They scream and dive at Typhus and Typhoid Mary. It\'s very beautiful. The moon looks like sex. The yachts look like sex. So do the birds and the water and the air. Typhus and Typhoid Mary climb onto one of the yachts and fuck. The birds scream.<br/></span></div>'), script: (x) => {/**/}},

The mother and the daughter are in the kitchen getting ready to bring out the food. The father is at the head of the table and the sons sit on either side of him. The father hits the table with his knife and looks toward the kitchen. The sons hit the table with their knives. The younger one smiles, restraining a laugh. <br/>The mother walks into the dining room. She carries in one hand a dinner plate with a spatchcock on it. In the other hand she has pommes frittes and green beans in a large silver bowl. She holds them with potholders. The plates are hot. The daughter follows her out. She carries two more spatchcocks. The mother puts the silver bowl in the middle of the table and the bird in front of the father. The daughter puts a plate each in front of the sons. The mother goes back to the kitchen for the bread and the daughter picks up the carafe of red wine. She walks around behind the father and fills his glass. The men begin to eat. The daughter walks around the table and pours drinks for the sons. She spoons the vegetables onto their plates. She grinds the pepper onto their meals. She stands back silent like a good waiter.  <br/>The father finishes his wine. She pours more for him. She lets some spill on the tablecloth. He looks at the wine then at her and smiles. She trembles and looks down at her feet.  <br/>He calls for the wife not taking his eyes from the daughter. He points out the spilt wine to her. He nods at the cane leaning against the dresser. Tears leak from the daughter\'s eyes. She places the carafe back on the table. <br/>The elder son pins her right wrist to the table and rips her dress in slow jerks down from the neckline. He lets go of her wrist and slides the ripped cloth down so that she is naked to the waist. Her breasts are small adolescent lumps.<br/>The younger son can\'t quite restrain his laugh. The father looks stern at him. They continue to eat and drink as they look at the daughter.<br/>The mother looks at the ground as she leads the daughter over to the chair at the foot of the table. She ties the daughters wrists to the chair back and her ankles to its legs with the cords that are hanging there. The daughter\'s arse is facing the table, she is almost bent over and her legs are apart. The younger son gets up and tears her dress completely away. He is still chewing. He picks up a knife from the table and cuts through her knickers. She has no pubic hair yet. The son sits back down.<br/>The mother takes the cane and beats the girl on the arse and thighs. She hits her five or six times and the father signals to her. The mother walks over to him. He wipes his hands on his napkin and undoes the buttons of her blouse, slowly. She begins to cry silently. The father removes the mother\'s clothes. Her underwear is red and shiny. She has on suspenders and stockings. Her shoes are high. The father lifts her tits so that the nipples poke out over the top of the bra. He slaps her and shoves her back toward the daughter. The younger son is smiling and the elders son\'s mouth is open.<br/>The mother hits the girl another fifteen times.  She puts down the cane and walks around the table to refill the wine glasses.

She winds bandages around her body from the chest to thighs. Sharon helps her. They fasten them over the arse and the belly.

Mostly she moves the hips and shoulders. She hands the end of one of the bandages around the arm to a man. She dances slowly away from him twirling the arm and shaking the hips. The bandage unwinds. She holds her end of it and gives the end of the other arm bandage to a man on the other side of the room. She dances away from him unwinding that bandage also. She spins and winds the bandages around the body. The two men stand and come forward so that they can still hang onto their ends of the bandages. She unwinds and circles the two men. They are now entwined. She knots the ends and they are tied up. She pushes them backwards. They sit on a chair together laughing.  The song ends. She pulls a scalpel from the folds of the leg bandage. The next song starts. It is "My Girlfriend Lives in the Ground".<br/>Typhoid Mary dances, hips and shoulders and pelvic grinds. She runs the scalpel lightly over the belly in circles and, down over the legs, she slices through the bandages. They drop away. A faint line of red shows where the scalpel met the skin.

His friends laugh. Typhoid Mary keeps dancing. She rips the surgical gauze away from the tits and shakes them. She leans backwards over a table and runs the scalpel over the tits.

They talk about mugs they have had.<br/><br/>"I was late for work one night," says Gabriel\'s Mother, "Gabriel had a cold and we\'d been to the doctor. I came in through the door holding him and bumped right into this prick of a cop who used to come in every so often for free sex. He liked me. I used to avoid him. Smug prick. He was coming out but he came straight back in. Decided he wanted half an hour with me as well. I didn\'t even have time to dress Gabriel up in his wings. I checked in with Louise, she owned the place then, and we went upstairs.<br/><br/>Gabriel played in the corner like always. I kept looking over to him and his nose was running & I tried to lean over to wipe it but I couldn\'t reach. The sergeant got pissed off. Jesus. They think it\'s sex you know and that you should pay attention or something. Anyway I was looking over at the darling boy. He played around in the sergeant\'s uniform and left a little dribble of snot on the nightstick. Then he lifted his gun. I can still see him waddling over to his corner with this huge gun hanging fron his fist, snot streaming, big smile on his face. My heart was in my mouth. I was terrified. I thought of every child and gun tragedy I\'d ever read about. I watched without breathing, frozen, and the sergeant humped away oblivious. Gabriel hid the gun in his pile of toys then he turned to me and started to chuckle. He picked up a gold painted water pistol and put it in the sergent\'s holster. He laughed and it brought on a coughing fit and the cop was coming and I began to laugh as well and someone yelled through the door that his partner was calling for him. Hysterical. He left without his gun of course. <br/><br/>I dragged Gabriel downstairs and cleaned him up a bit. I was just wiping his nose in the TV room when I heard my father\'s voice. I thought I was imagining it. I looked around the corner and there he was. Older. Fatter. Uglier. I nearly fainted. He was on his way upstairs with Crystal. I couldn\'t move. I think I went all pale. One of the girls asked me what was wrong. I said "That\'s my fucking father." She went hmmmm and looked at me and at Gabriel then went upstairs. I leaned back against the wall and stroked Gabriel\'s hair. I don\'t know how long for. She came back down. She took me by the hand and helped me upstairs to the room I worked in and there was dad, on the white velvet bed, tied up with gold cords and gagged. Crystal said "He\'s all yours." and they left. <br/><br/>Gabriel was hanging onto my skirt. "This is Grandpa." I said to him. "Grandpa?" he asked. "Yes darling." I said. I began to walk around the bed looking at the man. Gabriel kept saying "Grandpa?" <br/>I leaned over the bed and looked into my father\'s eyes, close, and I said "I\'ve got you where I used to lay." He started to feel fear then. I could see it. Ha. What a beautiful thing revenge can be. I set fire to his pubes and strolled up to his head to speak a little more then suddenly kapow. Blood and flesh spray up and kapow again and again and again. I didn\'t know what the fuck was going on. Jesus what a night. Gabriel was under the bed with the sergeant\'s gun shooting upwards.

She stands up and shuffles over to do the same thing facing the other way. All the men lean forward. She arches back and puts one hand between her legs from behind and points a finger like a prick again at the crotch. With the other hand she wanks the finger, close to one man\'s nose. She pokes his eyes as she comes. He yells and holds his hands to his face. His friends laugh. They think it is a good joke. Typhoid Mary shuffles and jumps towards the back picking up her clothes as she goes. The song ends as she reaches the bar. She pulls up the boxer shorts. The bald man is standing with his arms crossed. Typhoid Mary smiles at him. <br/>"No blood tonight boss." she says. <br/>"Hm" he says and hands her $50.00. <br/>The man behind the bar gives Typhoid Mary her tape.

Gabriel had to stay in for a while to dry out. Poor little bastard. When he got out I took him to work with me. He had a bassinet in the TV room. There was always someone in there to look after him. When he got older we dressed him up like Cupid sometimes. Little wings and gold paint all over. A bow and arrows. God he was beautiful. He was perfect. He was a joy ."<br/>"Cupid?" asks Typhoid Mary.<br/>"In the foyer there were these huge mirrors with gilt frames that had carved cupids on the top corners. We matched him to the decor." <br/>They laugh.<br/><br/>"I changed my working name to Venus after a while & kept him with me all the time. I worked in a room that was all white and gold. It was like a David Jones store. There were pictures of Venus and Adonis, cherubs on the ceiling, fake marble and gilt cupids on the bed head, mirrors allover the place. It gave me headaches. The curtains and covers were white velvet with nasty little stains. We moved the big mirrors with the cupids from the foyer into my room as well. <br/><br/>Gabriel would stand under them. I would pass him my clothes and lean on him a little as I got undressed. It helped alot. I have problems with balance, especially when I\'m tired. He had toys in the room, all white or gold so they weren\'t out of place. Sometimes he\'d wander off back to the TV room but usually he just played until the mug left. <br/><br/>At the end of the night we\'d have a bath together. The bathroom was all white tiles and gilt framed mirrors. There was a huge round bath with gold taps and gold backed scrubbing brushes, glass jars of bath salts and bubble bath and shit like that. I would run the water, peel off my clothes and put the radio on. He would open and close the jars of stuff and throw in whatever appealed. I\'d unbuckle his wings. By that time of night his gold would be wearing thin and there\'d be food stains down his front and sperm stains down mine. When the bath was full I\'d throw him in and he\'d laugh and choke a bit.

They climb down to get it and explore. Typhoid Mary is a few rocks away from Typhus. She sees Gabriel. She hasn\'t seen him since he died. This is his ghost. He\'s dead. <br/>"Hello my one and only. How I\'ve missed you." says Typhoid Mary. <br/>"Hello Mary." says Dead Gabriel.<br/>"Gabriel, Gabriel. Just now when I fucked him, just now when I came, I thought I\'m dead, I\'m dead and felt relief like a heroin rush. It feels like coming home. Coming home to you. It feels like calm and stillness. How are you?" says Typhoid Mary.<br/>"Ah. So well. It\'s good to see you Mary." says Dead Gabriel. <br/>He disappears. <br/>The sky doesn\'t look like sex any more. <br/>"Wierd shit." says Typhoid Mary.<br/></span></div>'), script: (x) => {/**/}},

The elder son is first. He comes in the daughter\'s face. He slaps her repeatedly when she spits the sperm onto his lap and retches. The younger son pulls her over. While he is pulling her head back and forth over his cock the father gets up and walks around the table. His fly is still open and his cigar is almost finished. He fucks the daughter up the arse while the younger son is coming in her mouth. The father stubs out his cigar on her right buttock as he comes. <br/>The daughter screams and cries. She lies on the floor as the men straighten their clothes. The mother refills their coffee cups. After a few minutes the daughter gets up and goes over to the side board. She puts the bottle of brandy and three brandy balloons on a tray and takes them over to a low table in the next room. The men come in and sit down. Still crying a little she pours their drinks then goes back into the dining room. She and her mother clear the table and wash the dishes.

Poor little darling was terrified. He dropped the gun and cried. "You little shit," I whispered in his ear, "I\'ve been planning this for years and you\'ve beaten me to it." We laughed. I paced the floor with him and we laughed. <br/><br/>There was a knock at the door and someone said "Are you alright sweetie? Need any help?" I said everything was fine and she looked in and saw the body and the blood and us and stopped for a second. She said "O good. Glad you\'re OK. I just thought I heard a noise." and she shut the door and went away. <br/><br/>We laughed some more. I stood above the body. I touched the blood on the holes in his throat, then the holes in his chest, then the holes in his stomach. My finger was wet with his blood. I looked back at Gabriel and he at me. I touched my finger to his nose and made it red. He giggled and stuck his own hand into the blood and wiped it over my face. It turned into a game like the ones we had in the bath. We smeared each other from head to foot with blood and flesh. We threw bits at each other and all around the room. There was blood on the ceiling, and the velvet drapes, and the walls and mirrors and carpets. We chased each other and squealed and fell over. I suppose it was quite sick really. But at the time... We ended up exhausted lying on the floor, his head on my chest. His nose was running again and we were wet through. I hauled him into the bathroom. The water turned pink when we got in. Handprints in blood all over the marble. Ha. The cleaner would have had a fit. <br/><br/>I dressed us both and we walked downstairs. I found Louise and I said "Lou I\'ve killed my father and he\'s upstairs in the bed." I handed her the gun. "It\'s the sergeant\'s." I said. She chewed on her lip and lipstick got on her teeth. She said "God." a few times. She pointed at the gun and asked "Is this what killed him?" I said yes and she said "I think we can work something out. I think the sergeant may even want to help here. Don\'t you worry honey. Don\'t you worry." I couldn\'t stop looking at the lipstick on her teeth. She told me to go and gave me some money. I took Gabriel to the cafe above the tattooist\'s like always.<br/><br/>"Was that the last night you worked there?" asks Typhoid Mary. "O no." says Gabriel\'s Mother, "I went back the very next night. The mattress on the bed was new. The walls and curtains had patches on them where they had been cleaned and when I was lying looking up over the shoulder of a Japanese businessman I saw some dried blood still sround the light fitting. On our way out in the morning Louise handed Gabriel his gold water pistol and patted him on the head."<br/><br/>Typhoid Mary and Gabriel\'s mother drink all the Passion Pop and fall asleep where they are sitting. When they wake up they both have hangovers. They call room service for diet pepsi and dry toast. They lie on the beds for hours without speaking.
