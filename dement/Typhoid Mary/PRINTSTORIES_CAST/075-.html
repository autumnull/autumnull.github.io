She picks up his cock and runs it over his lips.  "Open your mouth." she says.<br/>He does. <br/>She holds the cock so that it just touches his lips. "Wider." she says.<br/>He opens his mouth wider. She spits down his throat.    <br/>"Wider." she says.<br/>He opens his mouth wider. She touches the cock to his teeth.<br/>"What's this on your teeth?" she asks.<br/>The boy cries. "My cock." he says.<br/>"Keep your mouth open." she says.<br/>He opens his mouth again.<br/>"Please put it in my mouth." says the boy, "Please."<br/>She slaps his face. "Open your mouth." she says.<br/>He does. He cries. She holds the cock at his lips. She pushes her cunt hard against his groin. She comes. She puts the cock down on the floor. She lies still for a minute. She gets up and walks away.<br/>"Please." says the boy, crying, "Please, please."<br/>She leaves the room. The boy crawls slowly after her. He bumps into things. He leaves a trail of blood. He cries. He follows the sound of her heels on the floor.  "Please." he says, "Please, please."<br/><br/>Typhoid Mary walks up the stairs. The door and gate behind her are left open. The boy crawls after her. He bumps into the first step and cries more. Typhoid Mary reaches the door at the top. She opens it. She looks at the boy crawling up the steps after her. "Please." says the boy. He is still crying. Typhoid Mary goes through the door and leaves it open for him.<br/><br/>Typhoid Mary goes into the kitchen and makes herself a cup of coffee. The boy crawls into the kitchen. He collapses against the fridge. Typhoid Mary telephones her friend who is a nurse. The friend comes over. Together they clean the boy and dress his wounds. The nurse takes a pair of tweezers and removes all the pins and pieces of glass and metal from the boy's body. He also re-stitches some of the larger lacerations. It takes hours. They put the boy onto a fold up bed outside Typhoid Mary's room.<br/>"Shit Mary." says the friend who is a nurse, "They're going to lock you up for this stuff you do one of these days. This one is barely alive. How long have you been working on him?"<br/>"Today is the 13th day." says Typhoid Mary.<br/>"Shit Mary." says the friend, "Shit. You can't keep doing this. You can't do this to people."<br/>Typhoid Mary looks at the sleeping boy. He is heavily bandaged.<br/>"Yes I can." says Typhoid Mary.</span></div>
