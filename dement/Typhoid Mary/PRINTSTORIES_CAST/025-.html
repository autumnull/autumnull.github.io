It's easier. Why don't you just kill yourself Mary? Look at the blood." say the cuts.<br/>"I have a great life. I'm a lucky person. I'm too lucky to kill myself. I carry with me the burden of the unlucky. I owe them and I owe them with my living, with time, with my old age and with my health and my effort and my guilt. I know I'm not allowed to kill myself."<br/>"Heap of shit." say the cuts,"You don't owe them anything."<br/>"I don't owe them anything?" <br/>"Nothing."<br/>"Then what am I doing alive?"<br/>"Beats me."<br/></span></div>
