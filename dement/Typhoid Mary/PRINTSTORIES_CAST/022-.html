She finds fifty dollars in the pocket of the jeans she has just put on. She goes to the bottle shop around the corner and buys six bottles of Passion Pop and some white chocolate and catches a taxi to Gabriel's mother's motel. <br/>They sit by the window with a bottle each. They talk about mugs they have had.<br/><br/>"I was late for work one night," says Gabriel's Mother, "Gabriel had a cold and we'd been to the doctor. I came in through the door holding him and bumped right into this prick of a cop who used to come in every so often for free sex. He liked me. I used to avoid him. Smug prick. He was coming out but he came straight back in. Decided he wanted half an hour with me as well. I didn't even have time to dress Gabriel up in his wings. I checked in with Louise, she owned the place then, and we went upstairs.<br/><br/>Gabriel played in the corner like always. I kept looking over to him and his nose was running & I tried to lean over to wipe it but I couldn't reach. The sergeant got pissed off. Jesus. They think it's sex you know and that you should pay attention or something. Anyway I was looking over at the darling boy. He played around in the sergeant's uniform and left a little dribble of snot on the nightstick. Then he lifted his gun. I can still see him waddling over to his corner with this huge gun hanging fron his fist, snot streaming, big smile on his face. My heart was in my mouth. I was terrified. I thought of every child and gun tragedy I'd ever read about. I watched without breathing, frozen, and the sergeant humped away oblivious. Gabriel hid the gun in his pile of toys then he turned to me and started to chuckle. He picked up a gold painted water pistol and put it in the sergent's holster. He laughed and it brought on a coughing fit and the cop was coming and I began to laugh as well and someone yelled through the door that his partner was calling for him. Hysterical. He left without his gun of course. <br/><br/>I dragged Gabriel downstairs and cleaned him up a bit. I was just wiping his nose in the TV room when I heard my father's voice. I thought I was imagining it. I looked around the corner and there he was. Older. Fatter. Uglier. I nearly fainted. He was on his way upstairs with Crystal. I couldn't move. I think I went all pale. One of the girls asked me what was wrong. I said "That's my fucking father." She went hmmmm and looked at me and at Gabriel then went upstairs. I leaned back against the wall and stroked Gabriel's hair. I don't know how long for. She came back down. She took me by the hand and helped me upstairs to the room I worked in and there was dad, on the white velvet bed, tied up with gold cords and gagged. Crystal said "He's all yours." and they left. <br/><br/>Gabriel was hanging onto my skirt. "This is Grandpa." I said to him. "Grandpa?" he asked. "Yes darling." I said. I began to walk around the bed looking at the man. Gabriel kept saying "Grandpa?" <br/>I leaned over the bed and looked into my father's eyes, close, and I said "I've got you where I used to lay." He started to feel fear then. I could see it. Ha. What a beautiful thing revenge can be. I set fire to his pubes and strolled up to his head to speak a little more then suddenly kapow. Blood and flesh spray up and kapow again and again and again. I didn't know what the fuck was going on. Jesus what a night. Gabriel was under the bed with the sergeant's gun shooting upwards. He was still pulling on the trigger when I dragged him out but the bullets were all used up. I held him close<br/><br/><br/><br/></span></div>
