She pushes past the men sitting and drinking in the orange plastic swivel chairs. She goes behind the bar and through the door to the back room and dumps her bag on a table.<br/>"Hi boss." says Typhoid Mary. <br/>"Nngh." says the bald man.<br/>Typhoid Mary takes her clothes off. She holds onto the table for support when she's getting out of her jeans. She has surgical gauze taped over her tits and groin. She gets rolls of bandages from her bag. She winds a bandage around each leg to the height of stockings, and around each arm like long gloves. She pulls on a suspender belt and attaches the leg bandages. She winds bandages around her body from the chest to thighs. Sharon helps her. They fasten them over the arse and the belly. She takes a pair of red sequinned high heeled shoes and a handful of red diamante jewellery. She puts these on. She puts on black eyeliner and red lipstick without a mirror. A new woman comes into the back room. She has a large bag too. She starts to undress. <br/>"Hi." says Typhoid Mary, <br/>"Hi" says the new woman<br/>Typhoid Mary picks up her cassette and goes out to the bar. She gives the cassette to the barman. He puts it into the sound system and plays it. The song is "Dr Feelgood" by Aretha Franklin. The men slow their talking and turn their heads towards the bar. She walks into the room between the rows of men. They clap and stamp their feet. She moves the arse in an exaggerated way and shakes her hair like in the shampoo ads. She dances. Mostly she moves the hips and shoulders. She hands the end of one of the bandages around the arm to a man. She dances slowly away from him twirling the arm and shaking the hips. The bandage unwinds. She holds her end of it and gives the end of the other arm bandage to a man on the other side of the room. She dances away from him unwinding that bandage also. She spins and winds the bandages around the body. The two men stand and come forward so that they can still hang onto their ends of the bandages. She unwinds and circles the two men. They are now entwined. She knots the ends and they are tied up. She pushes them backwards. They sit on a chair together laughing.  The song ends. She pulls a scalpel from the folds of the leg bandage. The next song starts. It is "My Girlfriend Lives in the Ground".<br/>Typhoid Mary dances, hips and shoulders and pelvic grinds. She runs the scalpel lightly over the belly in circles and, down over the legs, she slices through the bandages. They drop away. A faint line of red shows where the scalpel met the skin. She dances, shaking the head and shaking the arse. She cuts a lock of hair from one man's head. He says Oi good naturedly. She deposits the hair in his open mouth. He spits it out. His friends laugh. Typhoid Mary keeps dancing. She rips the surgical gauze away from the tits and shakes them. She leans backwards over a table and runs the scalpel over the tits. She stands and cuts a fine line down the left arm. She wipes the blood on one mans cheek. The next song starts. It is "I've Got You Under My Skin" by Neneh Cherry. Typhoid Mary tears the surgical guaze away from the groin. She is now wearing nothing but the<br/></span></div>
