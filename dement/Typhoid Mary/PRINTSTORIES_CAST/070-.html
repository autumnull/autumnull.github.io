He pushes her head down level with the daughter's cunt and makes her kneel there. The mother shakes her head and cries some more. The father backhands her across the face. He goes back to his chair. The mother does oral on the daughter for a while.<br/><br/>The men have finished their food. The mother gets up and goes to the kitchen and brings back a platter of cheese and grapes. She makes a second trip for the coffee. The men stretch back in their chairs and pick at the cheese and grapes.<br/><br/>They sip the coffee. They continue to look at the daughter. Long red welts cover her skin. The younger son throws a few grapes at her.<br/>The father signals to the mother. She unties the daughter from the chair then and ties her wrists together behind her back with one of the pieces of cord. She leads the daughter to the table then stands back silent like a good waiter. <br/>The father lights a cigar. He undoes his fly and forces the daughter's head down onto his cock. He pulls her hair while she sucks him until he is hard. He pushes her away towards the sons and smokes some more. The sons take turns to also push her head down onto their cocks. The elder son is first. He comes in the daughter's face. He slaps her repeatedly when she spits the sperm onto his lap and retches. The younger son pulls her over. While he is pulling her head back and forth over his cock the father gets up and walks around the table. His fly is still open and his cigar is almost finished. He fucks the daughter up the arse while the younger son is coming in her mouth. The father stubs out his cigar on her right buttock as he comes. <br/>The daughter screams and cries. She lies on the floor as the men straighten their clothes. The mother refills their coffee cups. After a few minutes the daughter gets up and goes over to the side board. She puts the bottle of brandy and three brandy balloons on a tray and takes them over to a low table in the next room. The men come in and sit down. Still crying a little she pours their drinks then goes back into the dining room. She and her mother clear the table and wash the dishes. While the mother sweeps the floor the daughter wipes down the kitchen benches. After this she goes to her room, puts on her dressing gown and does her homework.</span></div>
