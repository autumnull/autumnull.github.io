<div style="background: #ffffff; width: 471; height: 432; text-align: left"><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12; font-family: Times;">They fuck again. They fuck every time they can for days. They fuck in public and in the car alot. It is the best romance. It is passion and joy and death. They have wild times. <br/><br/>The next night after Typhoid Mary's last show, they park in the drive way of a brothel. They walk to the pub and buy expensive scotch and a French champagne liqueur. They get back to the car. It has been parked in. They laugh and get in the back and fuck. There is a knock on the window. It is a policeman. He looks in. Typhus smiles at him. He smiles back and walks away. <br/><br/>They drive back to Typhus' place. Typhus stops the car and takes off his shirt. His motorbike is parked opposite the house. He starts it up and shifts it closer to the house so that he can chain it to the no-parking sign. He stops and sits backwards on the bike. Typhoid Mary sits on it too. He leans back against the handlebars and Typhoid Mary gives him a blowjob. Cars drive past. A taxi stops suddenly and backs up to see. Typhoid Mary and Typhus laugh.<br/><br/>They fuck again. They fuck every time they can for days. They fuck in public and in the car alot. It is the best romance. It is fervor and bliss and death. They have wild times. <br/><br/>The next night after Typhoid Mary's last show, they drive to an industrial plant of some kind, on the sea. It has high locked wire gates and security patrols. Typhoid Mary is wearing her psychadelic cowboy boots. Typhus is wearing a jacket that belongs to Typhoid Mary's dead friend Gabriel. They break in. They have a bottle of Benedictine and a bottle of Chivas Regal. They play commandos with the search light and hide from the security guard. They go down to the breakwater and climb down the cement pre-fabricated rocks. Typhus spreads the jacket on a rock. They fuck. The jacket falls down between the rocks. They climb down to get it and explore. Typhoid Mary is a few rocks away from Typhus. She sees Gabriel. She hasn't seen him since he died. This is his ghost. He's dead. <br/>"Hello my one and only. How I've missed you." says Typhoid Mary. <br/>"Hello Mary." says Dead Gabriel.<br/>"Gabriel, Gabriel. Just now when I fucked him, just now when I came, I thought I'm dead, I'm dead and felt relief like a heroin rush. It feels like coming home. Coming home to you. It feels like calm and stillness. How are you?" says Typhoid Mary.<br/>"Ah. So well. It's good to see you Mary." says Dead Gabriel. <br/>He disappears. <br/>The sky doesn't look like sex any more. <br/>"Wierd shit." says Typhoid Mary.<br/></span></div>
