She pushes past the men sitting and drinking in the orange plastic swivel chairs. She goes behind the bar and through the door to the back room and dumps her bag on a table. The heavy bald man is there. <br/>"Hello." says Typhoid Mary. <br/>"Nngh." he says. <br/>Typhoid Mary takes her clothes off. She holds onto the table for support when she's getting out of her jeans. She knocks an ashtray off. "Ah shit." says Typhoid Mary. She has on white silk boxer shorts and a white cotton singlet. From her bag she takes black shiny army boots and a worn trench coat. She puts these on. She fastens a gold chain around the neck. She puts on black eyeliner and red lipstick without a mirror. She puts three different shades of lipstick and small latex lumps on the belly in spots like a typhoid rash. It looks inflamed. Woo Woo and Sharon arrive. They also undress. <br/>"Could you go out first for me love?" says Sharon. <br/>"Yes." says Typhoid Mary, "Hi Woo Woo." <br/>Woo Woo giggles.<br/>Typhoid Mary picks up the cassette from her bag and goes out to the bar. She gives it to the barman. He puts it into the sound system and plays it. The song is 'I'm a Man' by Muddy Waters. It has a chorus that goes "I'm a MAN, man - child, that spelled M... A child, N..." The men in the chairs seem to know it. They smile. Two of the younger ones pretend to be playing  guitar. They scew up their faces, pout their lips, put their right hands on their cocks, left hands in the air and wiggle their fingers. The men turn their heads towards the bar. Typhoid Mary holds the trench coat closed and strides to the centre of the chairs. She stands still, looks around at the faces and jerks the coat open. She dances. Mostly she moves the hips and shoulders with the hands on the hips. She lets the coat drop down over the back. The song ends. She throws the coat at the men in the front row. The next song starts. It is "I'm a Wonderful Thing Baby" by Kid Creole and the Coconuts. Typhoid Mary dances: pelvic thrusting, hands on the groin. The tits almost fall out the sides of the singlet. It is too large. She lifts the arms and does muscleman poses. The men in the audience swivel to follow her moves. Mostly their mouths are open grins and their hands are near their groins. Typhoid Mary shapes up like a <br/>boxer. She punches the air and ducks the head. She punches one man lightly on the chin. "Ow. Bitch. Stop that." he says. He laughs for his friends. <br/>Typhoid Mary keeps dancing. She pulls off the singlet and holds one end tight in each hand. She uses it like a towel behind the neck and down back and forth over the back and arse. She brings it fast over to the front again and wraps it hard around the neck of a man in the front row and pushes the typhoid rash into his face then rips the singlet away to  do the same to the next man in the row. They protest. She shakes her tits close to their noses. She runs a hand from the throat, over the left tit, squeezes the nipple between two fingers, and down to the rash. The Kid Creole song ends and Suzy Quatro 's "I Wanna be your Man" starts up. Typhoid Mary lets go of the singlet. She presses one hand to the chest<br/><br/></span></div>
