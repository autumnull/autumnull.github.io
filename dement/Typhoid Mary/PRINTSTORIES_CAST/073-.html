Poor little darling was terrified. He dropped the gun and cried. "You little shit," I whispered in his ear, "I've been planning this for years and you've beaten me to it." We laughed. I paced the floor with him and we laughed. <br/><br/>There was a knock at the door and someone said "Are you alright sweetie? Need any help?" I said everything was fine and she looked in and saw the body and the blood and us and stopped for a second. She said "O good. Glad you're OK. I just thought I heard a noise." and she shut the door and went away. <br/><br/>We laughed some more. I stood above the body. I touched the blood on the holes in his throat, then the holes in his chest, then the holes in his stomach. My finger was wet with his blood. I looked back at Gabriel and he at me. I touched my finger to his nose and made it red. He giggled and stuck his own hand into the blood and wiped it over my face. It turned into a game like the ones we had in the bath. We smeared each other from head to foot with blood and flesh. We threw bits at each other and all around the room. There was blood on the ceiling, and the velvet drapes, and the walls and mirrors and carpets. We chased each other and squealed and fell over. I suppose it was quite sick really. But at the time... We ended up exhausted lying on the floor, his head on my chest. His nose was running again and we were wet through. I hauled him into the bathroom. The water turned pink when we got in. Handprints in blood all over the marble. Ha. The cleaner would have had a fit. <br/><br/>I dressed us both and we walked downstairs. I found Louise and I said "Lou I've killed my father and he's upstairs in the bed." I handed her the gun. "It's the sergeant's." I said. She chewed on her lip and lipstick got on her teeth. She said "God." a few times. She pointed at the gun and asked "Is this what killed him?" I said yes and she said "I think we can work something out. I think the sergeant may even want to help here. Don't you worry honey. Don't you worry." I couldn't stop looking at the lipstick on her teeth. She told me to go and gave me some money. I took Gabriel to the cafe above the tattooist's like always.<br/><br/>"Was that the last night you worked there?" asks Typhoid Mary. "O no." says Gabriel's Mother, "I went back the very next night. The mattress on the bed was new. The walls and curtains had patches on them where they had been cleaned and when I was lying looking up over the shoulder of a Japanese businessman I saw some dried blood still sround the light fitting. On our way out in the morning Louise handed Gabriel his gold water pistol and patted him on the head."<br/><br/>Typhoid Mary and Gabriel's mother drink all the Passion Pop and fall asleep where they are sitting. When they wake up they both have hangovers. They call room service for diet pepsi and dry toast. They lie on the beds for hours without speaking. Typhoid Mary realizes that it is Tuesday but it is too late for her to go to therapy.<br/></span></div>
