The inside forearm. Through the veins and arteries. One cut to each arm and feel the blood move. Feel the weight lift and say ooh or aaaah like at the touch of a lover. Feel abandon. And gone baby gone with the dizziness and gone with the nausea of blood loss. It blurs the edges. It takes the edge off. It rubs out the lines. It's a thumb over charcoal drawing.</span><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12; font-family: Palatino;"><br/><br/></span></div>
