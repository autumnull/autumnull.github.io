I am repulsive. I am worthless and vile . You are mistaken. If you stop touching me now I will bleed and bleed. I have no skin. Go away before you realize your mistake. Before you hurt me. Get away from me I am diseased. I will drag you down and you will do me damage. I will give you sores and fevers. I'm not the one you want. I am not someone who can be wanted. I am on the way out. I can feel this thing that moves from me to you and back again, this thing that is too much for me. It kills me. Sex moves things that should be still. I would like to give you all my vital organs. One at a time. You are perfect, best and only, first and last and me I live in small dark rooms.<br/></span></div>
