I'm going down again. So tell me what's it worth to live through it again?" says Typhoid Mary to no one.<br/>And so she kneels. She stops where she is and kneels and bends forward. Slow. She moves her forearms over her diaphram. Her hands hold her ribs. Her head rests, forehead on the floor. The pressure. The pull down. The ache. She thinks it's bleeding but there's no blood. Just weight and pain.<br/><br/>She injects some heroin and the sounds don't grate so much, and touch doesn't tear her skin, and the crying doesn't wrench.<br/>She kneels and bends forward. Slow. She moves her fore arms over her diaphram. Her hands hold her ribs. Her head rests, forehead on the floor. <br/>"Heroin is a good drug." she says to the floor. "It keeps me covered. Leaves me my clothes. Leave me covered. Don't ask me to be naked anymore."<br/></span></div>
