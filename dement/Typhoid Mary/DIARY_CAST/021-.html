<div style="background: #ffffff; width: 513; height: 198; text-align: left"><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 18; font-family: Helvetica; font-weight: bold;">DIARY<br/><br/></span><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 18; font-family: Helvetica;">Sun 8/12<br/><br/>Tomorrow I will go to work. The day after that I will do whatever is in my diary to do. The scream inside will scream. The frustration and incapacity will sit and fester beside my constant battle for the reason and comfort I hate. I will eat too much or too little. I will want to smoke and want to hit up and want to cut my flesh and I won't. <br/></span></div>
