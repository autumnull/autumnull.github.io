I think I could swallow all the anti- depressants in the cupboard and would it kill me? I don't know what pills can kill. I remember once I  took 19 phenobarbs and scotch and it didn't even touch the sides and the three days unconscious after barbiturates and retching in the bath at some stage. <br/>I read Anna Kavan & listen to the prisoners request show. J plays Isaac Hayes for me and I am happy for those minutes.<br/></span></div>
