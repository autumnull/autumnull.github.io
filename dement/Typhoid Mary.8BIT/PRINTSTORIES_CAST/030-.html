She goes into the room. It is down below, below the house. No windows. It is a little damp. It is quiet. It is dark. She turns on a light. A bare bulb with wire around it like a mechanic's light. A young man is chained to a wooden frame in the middle of the room. Iron around his wrists and ankles. A boy really. A beautiful boy.<br/><br/>"Let me off here. This has fucking gone far enough. Just let me go now you sick cunt."  says the beautiful young man. <br/>She smiles. "Today it begins." she says.<br/>"What do you mean? What do you mean begin? This is the end. I can't stand this. You're mad. Fuck you Fuck you Fuck you Fuck you Fuck you." he says. Tears show on his cheeks. His head rolls back. He makes a hopeless noise.<br/>"Hopeless hopeless hopeless ." she says. "Today it begins, with the right foot."<br/>"Jesus Christ you are fucking disturbed mad you bitch you're mad you should be locked up you idiot slag." he says.<br/><br/>She walks over to the boy's right foot. She drags behind her a cabinet on wheels. The wheels squeak. She opens it. She takes out a stool and sits on it. She takes out a basin of water, soap and a towel. She washes his right foot. Every curve. Every toe. She soaps it. She takes a cut throat razor and shaves the foot, even the parts that have no hair. She washes off the soap and dries the foot. She cuts the toenails with a pair of scissors and scrapes the grime from under them. She inserts a long thick silver pin under the toenail of the big toe. There are screams and movement. She inserts four more under the same toenail. Under the next toenail she inserts four pins. Under the next, three, and so on, until at the last toe, she inserts one pin. Drops of blood. There are drops of blood and screams and "No no no no stop it."<br/>But she doesn't.<br/>She inserts more of the pins. She spaces them a few centimetres apart. Lines of pins follow the lines of the tendons and the bones, follow the arch of the foot, the edge of the heel, the spaces in between. The pins stick out all over. She sits back and looks at it. She pulls some of the pins out. She holds the foot firmly and hammers the remaining pins in with a small hammer. The foot has lines of pin heads flat with the skin. She cuts lines of blood around them with the razor. She cuts the skin between the toes. The foot is flesh and blood and silver. Intricate. There is "No no  no  no  no." <br/>She ties thin black cord around sections of the foot. Too tightly. It bulges at the edges. The blood supply is blocked. She ties the four small toes backwards, under the foot. Over them she pushes a  stainless steel contraption. It has a hole for the big toe. It has clamps that hold the top to the bottom. She pushes it over the four toes. The big toe sticks out through the hole. She tightens the clamps until the four toes break.<br/></span></div>
