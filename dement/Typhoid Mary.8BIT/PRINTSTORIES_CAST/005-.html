She spits. She goes to the coffee shop around the corner. She sits down and orders a coffee. A boy with the face of a dead film star and the moves of a dead friend, sits down next to her. <br/>"Typhus." she says and hugs him. <br/>"Hello Mary. How are you these days? What are you doing with yourself?" says the boy, Typhus, "It's been so long."<br/>"When did you get into town?" says Typhoid Mary. "It has been so long."<br/>"Let's go for a drive Mary. I have a new car." says the boy. <br/>Typhoid Mary leaves the coffee. The car is parked in an alley. It is a panel van, midnight blue with bits of chrome. <br/>"Ha Ha." says Typhoid Mary, "A panel van, a fuck truck. Ha ha. It makes me feel like I'm a teenager again. Let's go parking."<br/>"Serious?" says Typhus. "Yes." says Typhoid Mary. <br/>They laugh and get in. They drive to a dark place by the water. There are other cars parked there. People in them are fucking. Typhoid Mary and Typhus talk. They haven't seen each other for a long time. They used to work the same place, years ago, in another town. They are friends.<br/>"Mary you look beautiful." says Typhus.<br/>"Not as beautiful as you." says Typhoid Mary. "Let's fuck."<br/>"I'm contagious Mary." says Typhus.<br/>Typhoid Mary feels strong desire, as strong as madness, like breathing.<br/>"I know. It's OK. I am too." says Typhoid Mary. She shows him her latex rash.<br/>They fuck. Typhus drives her back to the strip club for the 1.00 am show. They fuck again in the car in the alley then Typhoid Mary goes in through the door of the club carrying her bag and does the second show. <br/><br/>Typhoid Mary works two shows on Thursdays and Fridays and three on Saturdays at the strip club. On Tuesdays she goes to therapy.<br/><br/>After the one o'clock show Typhus is outside in the car. They fuck in the alley in the front of the car. He kneels on the floor. Typhoid Mary has her safety belt on. They drive around afterwards without getting dressed. They stop at the lights. People stare. They go back to Typhoid Mary's place. They fuck on the floor on a pile of furs. Typhus falls asleep there at Typhoid Mary's feet.<br/><br/>The next night after Typhoid Mary's last show, they drive to a small bay in a wealthy suburb. They walk down to the boatshed. They take a row boat and row out between the yachts. Some seagulls are woken up. They scream and dive at Typhus and Typhoid Mary. It's very beautiful. The moon looks like sex. The yachts look like sex. So do the birds and the water and the air. Typhus and Typhoid Mary climb onto one of the yachts and fuck. The birds scream.<br/></span></div>
