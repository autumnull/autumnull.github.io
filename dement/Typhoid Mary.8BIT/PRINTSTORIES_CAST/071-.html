<div style="background: #ffffff; width: 470; height: 192; text-align: left"><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12; font-family: Times;">red diamante jewellery, the latex sores, the blood beading along the cut and the stilettoes. She dances and slowly cuts a fine line up the right arm as if she was drawing on a long glove. The left arm is still bleeding. She stretches out both arms and shimmies. She rotates the arse and bends forwards. She reaches between the legs and cuts a line slow up the back of the right leg like a stocking seam. She straightens and turns the other way. She bends again and reaches through and cuts up the left leg the same way. Some of the men are watching closely and some turn away and look sick. There are confused murmurs from them. Typhoid Mary straightens again and dances over to the front row. She sits on the nearest lap, rolls over to lie on the next and rolls to sit again on the one after that. Their laps are bloodstained. The song is winding down. She dances towards the rear and is at the door to the back room by the time the music stops.<br/>The boss is standing there. <br/>"Take a holiday Mary OK? I don't want you back for a few weeks. You fucking disturbed. You take a holiday." He says.<br/>He gives her $200.<br/>She takes it. <br/></span></div>
