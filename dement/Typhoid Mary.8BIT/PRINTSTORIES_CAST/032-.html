The terrible body. The place where I don't want to be. The body that holds the grief in the lungs, the fear in the stomach, regret in the shoulders, razorblades in my cunt and the want want want in my veins. Sex will loosen these things that the body holds and these things can do such damage when not restrained. These things have no dignity and no reason and no respect for one's life." <br/>&nbsp;<br/>"These things can take over and put you in the bin. If they cannot be contained within the body then they will be contained in an institution or sated on William St. on heroin and hatred."<br/></span></div>
