The Beautiful Lesbian goes with her. <br/>Typhoid Mary goes in to the back room. She takes off her singlet and lowers her fishnet lingerie. The tattooist draws the design on her shoulder blade and shows her in a mirror. <br/>"That's it." says Typhoid Mary. <br/>The tattooist sprays antiseptic on her back and starts to tattoo. Typhoid Mary breathes and closes her eyes. The pain takes away the hatred. The pain takes away the burden and the torture. There is just the tattooing and the tattooist. It feels like love. It feels like truth and knowledge. There is no room for turmoil or doubt. The pain fills the hole. It is enough. "Here and now in this chair with my tattooist all is right with my world." says Typhoid Mary. <br/>She looks at the dirty lino near the fridge. The fridge has Harley Davidson stickers on it and a picture drawn by the tattooist's daughter. There is an extension cord and a mask with horns. American country rock music is playing. There is peace. Peace and love.The tattooist gets up and takes a coke from the fridge. He goes back to tattooing. Sometimes he sits back and drinks the coke and looks at Typhoid Mary's shoulder blade. <br/>The pain is just right. The pain is just enough. Typhoid Mary leans forward against the chair. The tattooist works on her shoulder blade. Typhoid Mary's mouth turns up a little in a smile.<br/>"This blood and love and steel is the only peace I have known for so long." says Typhoid Mary, "I can have peace for an hour, here and the Beautiful Lesbian is standing in front of me. Here and now in this chair, with the tattoist and her this is enough.<br/>When it is finished the tattooist holds up the mirror so Typhoid Mary can see the new tattoo. "It's beautiful." she says. She can't see a thing. She is too much at peace to be able to see.<br/></span></div>
