The one that's nearest your bladder."  "Scars?" says Typhoid Mary. <br/>She is in an elevator hurtling loose down into the pit.<br/>"What are they from?" asks the Beautiful Lesbian.<br/>"Could be from any number of times." says Typhoid Mary falling.<br/><br/>"I have scars in my cunt" says Typhoid Mary, "and I don't know how I got them. I have no memory of this but when I feel the scars I feel fear. I don't know this part of my past. I don't own it. Someone else knows it. Someone else caused it. Someone else is a man a bastard bastard fuck face man. I don't know who. I don't know what he did. I don't know when and his mark is in my cunt."<br/>"I wish I could have tattoos done over the scars." says Typhoid Mary, "But I don't think they'd do internal tattoos."<br/><br/>The Beautiful Lesbian puts her fist in Typhoid Mary's cunt. The cunt rips. There's blood. <br/>"I hope the scars re-opened." says Typhoid Mary, "I would love it if the scars were from the Beautiful Lesbian. I would love this way to wound the past, with this, with love. I know it's love because I'm bleeding."<br/></span></div>
