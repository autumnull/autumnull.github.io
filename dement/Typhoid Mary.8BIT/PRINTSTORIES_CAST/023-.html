"Great news ," he says, "I've got your test results back and you haven't got typhoid after all. You're going to live, live, LIVE."<br/>"Great." says Typhoid Mary<br/>She thinks it doesn't feel great. Not that it's bad, but she has to adjust. She thinks,"It's like being really tired after days of working and not sleeping and working and you're just dying to go to sleep in your comfortable bed that you've just put clean sheets on and your favourite pillow is all fluffed up, waiting for you at home. You get home to find all these friends, that you love, really alot, having a wild party in your room, spilling beer on the sheets, burning holes in the pillow with cigarettes, and they say,  "SURPRIZE Mary. Yahoooooo. We thought we'd do something nice for you because we like you so much so we're throwing a party for you." They turn the music up loud and kiss you and make you dance with them."<br/>"I want another test." says Typhoid Mary<br/>"That's a good idea Mary." says her doctor.<br/></span></div>
