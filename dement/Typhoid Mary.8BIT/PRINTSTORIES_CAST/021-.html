She walks for an hour or so. Just anywhere. She finds herself at  Gabriel's Mother's motel. <br/>She is lying in bed watching in-house videos and drinking lemon lime and hock. Typhoid Mary lies down on the other bed.<br/>"How did you lose your leg?" she asks.<br/>"My father was a welder." says Gabriel's mother, "He liked violent sex and had a thing about branding. One day when I was a kid he tried to put his initials on my thigh between the top of my stockings and the edge of my suspenders with the oxy. It was a mess. It got infected and gangrenous. By the time he took me to see a doctor it was too far gone. While I was in hospital he made up some ordinary metal brands so it never happened again."<br/>"Did he mind it that you only had one leg?" asks Typhoid Mary.<br/>"I think he really liked it. Sometimes, before he fucked me, he would make me stand on a chair, naked except for my crutch, and he'd walk around me and stare." <br/>They watch the video. When it ends Typhoid Mary kisses Gabriel's Mother and leaves.</span></div>
