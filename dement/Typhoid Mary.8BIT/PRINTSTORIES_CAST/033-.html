Between them on the bedside table is a cask of red wine. They each have a glass in their hand. The TV is on. A music video program is showing.<br/><br/>"Who was Gabriel's father?" asks Typhoid Mary<br/>"I don't know." says Gabriel's mother, "I was working. I was popular with the mugs. I think the missing leg intrigues them. I made alot of money so I used alot of heroin. It wasn't until I was about 5 months gone that I realized I was pregnant. Life was a blur. You know how it gets. I worked right through to the 9th month. Some of the mugs seemed to like the bulge. I had two weeks off when he was born. I got my dealer to deliver to the hospital. Gabriel had to stay in for a while to dry out. Poor little bastard. When he got out I took him to work with me. He had a bassinet in the TV room. There was always someone in there to look after him. When he got older we dressed him up like Cupid sometimes. Little wings and gold paint all over. A bow and arrows. God he was beautiful. He was perfect. He was a joy ."<br/>"Cupid?" asks Typhoid Mary.<br/>"In the foyer there were these huge mirrors with gilt frames that had carved cupids on the top corners. We matched him to the decor." <br/>They laugh.<br/><br/>"I changed my working name to Venus after a while & kept him with me all the time. I worked in a room that was all white and gold. It was like a David Jones store. There were pictures of Venus and Adonis, cherubs on the ceiling, fake marble and gilt cupids on the bed head, mirrors allover the place. It gave me headaches. The curtains and covers were white velvet with nasty little stains. We moved the big mirrors with the cupids from the foyer into my room as well. <br/><br/>Gabriel would stand under them. I would pass him my clothes and lean on him a little as I got undressed. It helped alot. I have problems with balance, especially when I'm tired. He had toys in the room, all white or gold so they weren't out of place. Sometimes he'd wander off back to the TV room but usually he just played until the mug left. <br/><br/>At the end of the night we'd have a bath together. The bathroom was all white tiles and gilt framed mirrors. There was a huge round bath with gold taps and gold backed scrubbing brushes, glass jars of bath salts and bubble bath and shit like that. I would run the water, peel off my clothes and put the radio on. He would open and close the jars of stuff and throw in whatever appealed. I'd unbuckle his wings. By that time of night his gold would be wearing thin and there'd be food stains down his front and sperm stains down mine. When the bath was full I'd throw him in and he'd laugh and choke a bit. He learned to swim in there. I'd turn the spa jets on and he'd press his <br/><br/></span></div>
