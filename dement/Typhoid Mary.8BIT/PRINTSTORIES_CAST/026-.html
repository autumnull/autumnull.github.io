It doesn't do it."<br/>"You can take heroin." says Typhoid Mary, "Heroin works. Not for a long time, but right now it would work."<br/>"No. Not heroin." says Sister Antonia, "What life can you or I have that would be better, that would be closer to something that satisfies?"<br/>"I don't know." says Typhoid Mary, "I have a great life. It is the best possible life for me and it is nowhere near enough." <br/>"How do you know that this is the best possible life for you?" asks Sister Antonia.<br/>Typhoid Mary thinks for a while.<br/>"Because it is what I am left with when I discard the parts that I don't want." she says.<br/>Sister Antonia and Typhoid Mary hold hands.<br/>"So how can I be happy with my new love, the Toshiba ?

And aside from everything everything there is this hole there is this want. It's so hard." says Sister Antonia, "When were you the most down? was it when you were fucking that guy with that disease?"<br/>"No." says Typhoid Mary, "That was a good time.
