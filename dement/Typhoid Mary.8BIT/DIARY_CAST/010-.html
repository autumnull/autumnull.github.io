The feelings I feel that are love and desire are grief and amputation. I miss the one I love already. The separation comes with the meeting. It kills me. I know they will die soon. All my friends die. That's the way it goes.<br/>This one that makes me feel so who is breath & touch & warmth to me and whom I know will die soon is the ones who are dead already who once were this one breath and warmth and touch and soon to die.<br/>And this is not true. They aren't really all dead.<br/></span></div>
