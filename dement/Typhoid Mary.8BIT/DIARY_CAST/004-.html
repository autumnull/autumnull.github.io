<div style="background: #ffffff; width: 511; height: 180; text-align: left"><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 18; font-family: Helvetica; font-weight: bold;">DIARY</span><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 18; font-family: Helvetica;"><br/><br/>Mon 8/4<br/><br/>I can't work. Why can't I work? It is the thing that saves me that makes me live and I am incapable. <br/>A razor cut to the forearm might let it out as if it is the skin that binds me. A cut, a mouth to speak, red to paint, new flesh exposed. Sounds like art to me.<br/></span></div>
