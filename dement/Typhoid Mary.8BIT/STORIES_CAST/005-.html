He left it to Typhoid Mary in his will. The computer rings her. It lives in an office downtown. <br/>"How are you Mary?" Sister Antonia  asks, "Really, are you O.K.? I haven't heard from you in weeks." <br/>"Yeah. I'm fine. I'm great." says Typhoid Mary<br/>"Are you getting any?"<br/>"Kind of." says Typhoid Mary "but I just can't cope with sex."<br/>"You only say that because you can get it whenever you want." says Sister Antonia .<br/>"And you only say that because you're not getting any." says Typhoid Mary<br/>Sister Antonia  laughs. <br/>"Anyway," she says, "I'm organizing your income. I've got you two dates to strip, Thursdays and Fridays, daytime, regular shows for four weeks. Be there at 9am. It's a sociology  group from the university. They want to know about the cultural expressions of the quasi-criminal. On Wednesdays they play soccer with the guys in Long Bay and on Thursdays they do something or other with the trannies from Les Girls. They want some new experiences, something wild, you know. Be there. You need the money."<br/>Typhoid Mary says "How can you get me money to give people experiences, when you know and I know it's not possible to give people experiences. It just doesn't work that way. You are getting me money on false pretenses ."<br/>"Mary, Mary, Mary," says Sister Antonia, "That's how people get money. No wonder you've never had a decent income. You know it's false pretences, I know it's false pretences and the people who are paying don't give a shit. How do you think I bought my office? my periferals? my trips to the U.S. of A.? Just be there on Thursday O.K.? Bye Mary."<br/>"Bye Sister Antonia ."<br/></span></div>
