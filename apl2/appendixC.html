<h2>APL Blossom Time</h2>
<p><span class="small-caps">APL2</span> continues the rich tradition of the <span class="small-caps">APL</span> programming language, first defined and implemented by Kenneth Iverson and Adin Falkoff and their team which included Larry Breed and Dick Lathwell. <span class="small-caps">APL</span> and <span class="small-caps">APL2</span> advocates have an esprit all their own as evidenced by the following song written by Michele Montalbano. This song encapsulates the early history of <span class="small-caps">APL</span>.</p>

<div class="line-block">Back in the old days, in 1962,<br>
A feller named Ken Iverson decided what to do.<br>
He gathered all the papers he’d been writing for a spell<br>
and he put them in a little book and called it <span class="small-caps">APL</span>.<br>
<br>
<em>Well!…</em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He got him a jot and he got him a ravel<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he revved his compression up as high as she could go<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he did some reduction and he did some expansion<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he sheltered all his numbers with a ceiling and a flo’.<br>
<br>
Now Sussenguth and Falkoff, they thought it would be fine<br>
To use the new notation to describe the product line.<br>
They got with Dr.&nbsp;Iverson and went behind the scenes<br>
And wrote a clear description of a batch of new machines.<br>
<br>
<em>Well!…</em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They wrote down dots and they wrote down squiggles<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they wrote down symbols that they didn’t even know.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they wrote down questions when they didn’t know the answers<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they made the Systems Journal in nineteen sixty-fo’.<br>
<br>
Now writing dots and squiggles is a mighty pleasant task<br>
But it doesn’t answer questions that a lot of people ask.<br>
Ken needed an interpreter for folks who couldn’t read<br>
So he hiked to Californ-i-a to talk to Larry Breed.<br>
<br>
<em>Oh!…</em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He got Larry Breed and he got Phil Abrams ’<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they started coding <span class="small-caps">FORTRAN</span> just as fast as they could go<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they punched up cards and ran them through the reader<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Stanford, Palo Alto, on the seventy-ninety-oh.<br>
<br>
Well, a <span class="small-caps">FORTRAN</span> batch interpreter’s a mighty awesome thing<br>
But while it hums a pretty tune, it doesn’t really sing.<br>
The thing that we all had to have to make our lives sublime<br>
Was an interactive program that would let us share the time.<br>
<br>
<em>Oh!…</em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They got Roger Moore and they got Dick Lathwell,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they got Gene McDonnell with his carets and his sticks,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you should’ve heard the uproar in the Hudson River valley<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they saved the first <code>CLEANSPACE</code> in 1966.<br>
<br>
Well, when Al Rose saw this he took a little ride<br>
In a big station wagon with a typeball by his side.<br>
He did a lot of teaching and he had a lot of fun<br>
With an old, bent, beat-up 2741.<br>
<br>
<em>Oh!…</em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It typed out starts and it typed out circles<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An it twisted and it wiggled just like a living thing.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Al fed it a tape when he couldn’t get a phone line<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it purred like a tiger with its trainer in the ring.<br>
<br>
Now there’s much more to the story, but I just don’t have the time<br>
(And I doubt you have the patience) for an even longer rhyme.<br>
So I’m ending this first chapter of the tale I hope to tell<br>
Of how Iverson’s notation blossomed into <span class="small-caps">APL</span>.<br>
<br>
<em>So!…</em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep writing nands when you’re not writing neithers,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And point with an arrow to the place you want to be,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But don’t forget to bless those early <span class="small-caps">APL</span> sources<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who preserved the little seedling that became an <span class="small-caps">APL</span> tree.</div>
