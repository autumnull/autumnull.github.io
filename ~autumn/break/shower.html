  <h1>heat.</h1>
    <p>there’s a guy in the stairwell, knocking on the door of your flat.</p>
<p>or at least, probably a guy. not that it changes anything. cresting the uneven concrete staircase, you survey him in order of appearance. his hair is dyed magenta, messy but trim. piercing in his eyebrow, spider bite, helix. he’s slightly red in the face, either the weather or substances — he turns to lean unsteadily against the doorframe — probably substances. two large scars on his chest under a mesh top, and a handful of tattoos. not very muscular, a generous cut of fat and hair on his belly and bare thighs, grubby grey socks. as tall as you when you’re two steps down.</p>
<p>he seems relieved to see you, a little sheepish.</p>
<p>“hey, um, do you have a key? i just went downstairs for a joint because i got kinda overwhelmed with the uh, noise, like, my head, but now the door’s shut and i can’t get anyone to come let me in, i left my bag in there and stuff i thought i wedged the door open but like, now i can’t call anyone and, i really need to sit down”</p>
<p>your brain’s reward systems enjoy being asked to help, their caring wellspring clouding with the warm blush spreading down the neck in front of you. a tired switchboard operator stretches to patch your neurons into a jack labelled “conversing”.</p>
<p>“oh, hey. i have my keys. have we met before?”</p>
<p>“maybe? sorry i forget faces really fast, i’m also high on, several different things right now so like, don’t take it personally”</p>
<p>“it’s chill don’t worry. nice fang by the way”, pointing to an inky figure. “collarbone, you must have a good pain tolerance”</p>
<p>“thanks, yeah it’s to remember my dog. i uh, my pain tolerance isn’t actually that good, i just got a painful one on purpose cos, uh, r- uh,i’m a freak”</p>
<p>“oh? i couldn’t tell” (the wings of his eyeliner flit clumsily into your tits before perching bashfully on the bannister) “so are you a furry or, puppy boy, what’s your thing”</p>
<p>“haha uhm, not really. i’m… i just like dogs” he scratches behind his ear. “you said you had keys? are you the new flatmate?”</p>
<p>“nah, i live here” you gesture with your keys. “you’re probably looking for the flat above”.</p>
<p>“…oh, whoops. my bad, shit. ughh these stairs are nauseating”</p>
<p>“if you like you can sit in my place for a bit? it’s quieter down here”</p>
<p>“um, i-”</p>
<p>“i can get you a bowl of water”</p>
<p>“fuck. sure. where’s your <a href="bathroom.html">bathroom</a>. bitch.”</p>
