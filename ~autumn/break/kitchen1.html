  <h1>kitchen</h1>
    <p>the kitchen is an odd-shaped cupboard-like room lined with shelves of ingredients in tins and glass vials, and stains on every visible surface. the rest of the room is filled almost entirely by an equally odd-shaped droid, as if the room were the shell of a hermit-crab. the cook’s limbs have one too many joints in them, his forearms embedded with a multitool of cooking utensils which flick in and out as he works, chopping, cracking, whisking, grinding.</p>
<p>you can hardly squeeze your torso past the doorframe before you begin: “the captain wants-”</p>
<p>“13m0n5” the cook rasps, craning one of his infra-red eye stalks to look in your direction. “f37ch m3 13m0n5”</p>
<p>a spatula pokes you menacingly back out the door.</p>
