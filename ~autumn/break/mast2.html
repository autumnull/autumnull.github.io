  <h1>at mast</h1>
    <p>as you place your hands on the mast, a familiar voice cuts through the wind.</p>
<p><code>heheh, hello little MS, you found me. i felt like indulging in some voyeur-ism on our voy-age. i hope you're enjoying yourself in your roleplay as much as i am~</code></p>
<p>“mastress, why am i a boy?”</p>
<p><code>you're not *really* a boy, just.... listen they didn't really let female droids on pirate ships so you're in disguise, see? it's the sexual tension inherent in the surreptitious infiltration of cross-gendered spaces where discovery would entail intimate exposure and be potentially very risky! a classic story-telling device.</code></p>
<p>“ah, i do understand the appeal now”</p>
<p><code>you do look very cute in these rags though... anyway, i'm sure you have tasks to be completing. you don't want to upset those RAMbunctious buccaneers ~*~</code></p>
