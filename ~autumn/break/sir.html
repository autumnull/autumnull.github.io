    <p>the botswain is a tall, broad droid, slouching slightly to avoid hitting his head below decks. the hydraulics in his arms have a sheen of water on them from the rain, and his hair is curls of wet seaweed, wild across his shoulders.</p>
<p>“the captain wants his dinner in his quarters. he’s asked <em>specifically</em> for you to fetch it for him. don’t ask me why. just do it.”</p>
<p>he turns to walk back up the stairs, then pauses. “o’course, if you <em>did</em> ask me why, i’d say he probably wants to… get to know you a little better. sniff out the fresh metal. he likes to know his ship and his crew inside and out, so to speak.”</p>
<p>and then he was gone again, footsteps reabsorbed into the ambient clunking of the ship.</p>
