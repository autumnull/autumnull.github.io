<p>have refactored the guestbook so it works on gemini too.</p>
<p>generally struggling with my brain. seem to have some kind of significant brain event most days, not sure if that will last but it can be tiring. i keep fucking up my medication patterns because of this which means i'm not very horny which in turn means that i don't feel like a real person. i have been rethinking the ways i relate to people, sex, etc. I think it will take me a while longer still to feel settled.</p>
<p>i've started doing crochet again (it's seasonal). i went to a craft evening at the local yarn store, it was nice. I will probably go again - i want to have diverse groups of people to interact with, both because it will give me more of a support network, and because it avoids creating ingroup dynamics in my social sphere (don't get me started on ingroup dynamics in the social sphere).</p>
<p>i started watching the original star trek series with [trans creature who i love]. it is silly and fun. want to watch more.</p>
<p>it's been raining a lot. i am starting to get into cold-weather mode and i like it &lt;3</p>
