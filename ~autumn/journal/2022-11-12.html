<p>Doing fine. Learning hare, the programming language, it's really good. Looking into translating the text editor code i've written so far into it, because i want it to be faster and littler. Anyway it's good.</p>
<p>As i write this i'm torrenting all of star trek TOS. I am looking forward to watching more of it, i think i could get really into it. But i want to savor it a little. It's weird and nice.</p>
<p>Main stressor in my life has returned- frustratingly -to being my transition. GP won't take my bloods or prescribe for me, and i'm now out of E patches and i'm due a blocker shot. I'm really mad about it, i am mad that the world is one big traffic jam of power structures shrugging and gesturing at each other. I am getting the urge to just piss off and sit in a field for a week or more. Maybe i will do this. Maybe i won't. it would take some small planning.</p>
<p>I had to stop my progesterone for a bit because i fucked up my ass, lol. Back on those now tho. My teeth is kinda fucked up but i think they'll get better if i keep taking care of them.</p>
<p>Kinda getting sick of sit-at-computer-write-programs-ville. Hankerin to be doing other things. I will find other things to do in the next little while, probably. Watching star trek is number one. Want to spend more time with people i like. don't know where a lot of the last month went. but that's okay. settling, i guess. love u. &lt;3</p>
